{"instruction":"","input":"You can, for example, automate quality control at various points along the production line using computer vision, rather than conducting manual visual checks at the end. This means less waste as you won\u2019t have to discard or rework as many fully assembled products. Ensure compliance\nCompliance activities include conforming to regulatory, industry, customer, and internal requirements. Life science manufacturers have a particularly heavy compliance burden, but it\u2019s a requirement in every sector. Quality teams need to ensure that processes, products, and services conform with regulations and best practices. \n Operationalize sustainability\nThis can be about monitoring and managing energy, water, and other resource usage using the IoT (e.g. Veolia Aquavista). Central to all of this is the need to Bring IT\/OT together to enable effective data-driven communication\nBusiness IT systems include the enterprise quality management system (EQMS), enterprise resource planning (ERP), and product lifecycle management (PLM) OT is the technology used in laboratory, manufacturing, and ongoing service delivery. Collaboration is vital. [For example, collaboration is critical for quality management, as quality is by nature cross-functional and global. Quality Management often sits in the IT domain, while Quality Execution is in the OT domain.] 2. Industrial campus digital infrastructure Reliable connectivity is critical for firms to leverage statistical process control data. Private mobile networks (5G) use network slicing to support many applications with different data rates and latency constraints \u2013 for example, autonomous vehicles need to interpret their environment in real-time, whereas temperature sensors don\u2019t require such extremely low latency connections. No single connectivity mode will suit all the requirements of the diverse range of applications your firm needs to support. You\u2019re likely to also need Wi-Fi, Long Power Wide Area Networks (like LoRa or NB-IoT), Bluetooth low energy, and RFID \u2013 depending on the application (something which we can advise you on). Edge devices will be critical, which often perform analytics at the device, make predictive\/prescriptive decisions (shut this machine down, and come for repair), and decide which data to send to central multi-cloud environments. Wrapping around this is identity-based and contextual cybersecurity, spanning OT\/IT systems.\n 3. IoT solutions and blockchain Predictive maintenance\nFor machine operators and factory managers, unnecessary maintenance and asset repairs consume unnecessary resources and dramatically increase operational costs. A single hour of downtime can cost a large enterprise over $100,000 in lost productivity and impact customer satisfaction if output is reduced and orders are delayed. Predictive maintenance is about fixing machines before they fail, and avoiding unnecessary early interventions, based on an understanding of machine behavior patterns.\n\n[According to McKinsey Better predictive maintenance using IoT can reduce equipment downtime by up to 50 percent and reduce equipment capital investment by 3 to 5 percent. In manufacturing, these savings have a potential economic impact of nearly $630 billion per year in 2025. (Source: Manyika, James, et al., \u201cUnlocking the potential of the Internet of Things.\u201d McKinsey & Company. June 2015)] Augmented and virtual reality\nAugmented reality (AR) is an overlay of virtual content on physical assets or surroundings. This has many applications in operations, allowing workers to \u201csee\u201d machines earmarked as predicted to fail soon and how to fix them, or the same with product.\nVirtual reality (VR) simulates the real world and offers value for operations and management. It can be used to improve competency and reduce risk by simulating operations prior to executing in the physical world. Automated quality control (computer vision)\nML (machine learning) can identify, diagnose, and eventually predict a pattern that will result in a negative outcome, such as product or process failure. Prescriptive analytics are more advanced; they predict failure and specify what should be done to address or change the outcome, and usually include some level of autonomous behavior.\n Wearables (health and safety)\nFrom chemical exposure to equipment incidents and from fatigue to falls, there are numerous dangers in a variety of workplaces across the globe that IoT and wearables can address. Asset tracking\nSuppliers continue to grow in importance as their percentage of the value of components from third parties in the end products grows. Firms are working to adopt and mature supplier quality management (SQM) to ensure the timely delivery of materials or components to the right specifications. \n\nEqually important is intralogistics \u2013 the efficient flow of materials and use of vehicles and tools across your own site. Environmental monitoring and ethical sourcing\nBlockchain is a transformative technology, which is increasingly important for SQM (Supplier quality management) and traceability. It is essentially a secure, public, distributed ledger. Each block is a record, containing a time-stamp linked to relevant data in a way that can\u2019t be altered or tampered with. \n\nTraceability is another challenge \u2013 to ensure supplies are from ethical, fair-trade sources and in recall scenarios. Blockchain can questions like, \u201cWhere did this part come from; who touched it along the supply and demand chain, and where is it now?\u201d\n\n[It can also be used to incentivize and expedite the recycling of products at their end of life. Orange, for example, is using blockchain to ensure our TV set-top boxes and broadband routers are refurbished and reused at least five times throughout their lifespan and the gold is recovered and put back into the supply chain as part of our circular economy business model.] Digital twins\nDigital twins combine and build upon existing digital engineering tools, incorporating additional data sources, adding advanced simulation and analytics capabilities, and establishing links to live data generated during the product\u2019s manufacture and use. \n 4. Integration As manufacturing firms become even more digitally dependent end-to-end systems integration across the OT\/IT domains is vital. This needs to be combined with advanced threat intelligence, as well as protective security to minimize known risks, and defensive security as new types of attack emerge. 5. Data analytics and science Data on productivity, quality, and sustainability metrics need to be made actionable. Data foundations\nThe first step is getting your data foundations right with the right data management across multi-cloud environments. This is in addition to data lakes and data mesh architectures to manage diverse types of data and enable self-service access to that data.\n Automating the analysis of data \nIs also important as we increasingly need near-real-time data insights. Having the right data tooling, using advanced ML (machine learning) algorithms, is key.\n Data visualizations\nVisualizing data so people in front line roles can take the right decisions is then the next step. Traditional visualizations include reports, charts, and dashboards, whereas big data visualizations include mashup apps that combine content (video, weather, text, schedules, etc.) from multiple sources into a single view and interface.","output":"It seems like you've provided a comprehensive overview of the different digital solutions that Orange provides to manufacturing firms.

My response was, \"It depends. If you are looking for a 300-page strategy paper, then probably not. However, if you are looking to create a Digital Business Strategy that is truly customer-centered, then maybe yes.\" The point I was making is that we are not a business consulting firm that creates 5-year transformation programs with the hope that change will magically materialize at the other end of the tunnel. We are a Digital Experience Company, and everything we do needs to have a clear purpose with the human at the center.\n\nSo, let me ask you a question: Are you putting the human in the center of your change initiatives? If not, let's explore why you should and how to make it happen.\n\n**The Missing Link in Traditional Change Management**\n\nToo often, companies approach change management from the top down. They hire consultants to map out change programs and transformation initiatives that look impressive on paper but are hard to implement because they are detached from the human. This approach tends to focus on processes and technologies while neglecting the most crucial element: people.\n\nWhy is this a problem? Making change is hard. People, by design, don't want to change. Sure, some do, but most don't. Change becomes almost impossible if you don't put the human in the center. This is where a customer-centric approach can make all the difference.\n\n**Customer-Centricity: The Key to Successful Change**\n\nCustomer-centricity is about understanding your customers' needs, desires, and pain points and using this insight to drive your strategy and decisions. When you place the human at the center of change, you create a culture where employees are motivated to contribute to the betterment of the customer experience. So, how can you put the human in the center of your change efforts?\n\n1. **Empathy:** Start by genuinely understanding your customers and employees. What are their needs, desires, and frustrations? Develop empathy maps to capture these insights and use them as a foundation for your change initiatives.\n2. **Co-creation:** Involve your customers and employees in the process of designing and implementing change. By working together, you can ensure that the changes you make are meaningful and relevant to the people they impact the most.\n3. **Iterative approach:** Adopt an iterative approach to change, using feedback loops to learn and adapt continuously. This approach allows you to make small, manageable changes that can be refined and improved over time, making it easier for people to adapt and contribute.\n4. **Communication and transparency:** Keep an open dialogue with your customers and employees throughout the change process. Be transparent about your goals, progress, and setbacks. This helps to build trust and ensures that everyone is on the same page.\n\n**Starting the Conversation: Are You Ready to Put the Human in the Center of Change?**\n\nPutting the human in the center of change is not a one-time exercise; it's a mindset that requires continuous effort and commitment. By adopting a customer-centric approach to change management, you can create an environment where people are inspired and empowered to drive meaningful, lasting change.\n\nSo, are you ready to put the human in the center of your change initiatives? Are you prepared to embrace a customer-centric approach to transform your business and deliver exceptional digital experiences? If so, let's start a conversation.

Because time domain multiplication is equivalent to frequency domain convolution we get a period spectrum. And lastly, the Nyquist criterion is visually observed to be sampling rate the prevents the images from overlapping which is 2 times the bandwidth of the signal being sampled.","output":"Yes, that's a great way to explain the Nyquist criterion! You are correct that the time domain multiplication is equivalent to frequency domain convolution, and this results in a periodic spectrum in the frequency domain. The Nyquist criterion states that the sampling rate must be greater than twice the bandwidth of the signal being sampled in order to prevent the images from overlapping and avoid aliasing.\n\nVisualizing the Nyquist criterion in the frequency domain helps to understand why the sampling rate must be greater than twice the bandwidth of the signal.

{"instruction":"","input":"Summarize the text regarding joint tenancy:\n JOINT, COMMON, OR COMMUNITY OWNERSHIP\nJoint, common, or community ownership or co-ownership means simultaneous ownership of a\ngiven piece of property by several persons (two or more).4 The types of such ownership interests\ninclude the following:\nTenancy in Common\nTenancy in common exists when several (two or more) persons are owners of undivided interests\nin the title to real property. It is created if an instrument conveying an interest in real property to\ntwo or more persons does not specify that the interest is acquired by them in joint tenancy, in\npartnership, or as community property. Some instruments of transfer\/deeds of conveyance\nclearly state the intentions of the persons acquiring are to hold title as tenants in common.5 No\nright of survivorship exists for individual tenants when title is held as tenants in common. The\nundivided interest of a deceased tenant in common passes to the beneficiaries (heirs or devisees)\nof the estate subject to probate, pursuant to the last will and testament of the deceased or by\nintestate succession. The heirs or devisees of the deceased simply take the tenant's place among\nthe other owners who continue to hold title to the property as tenants in common.6\nJoint Tenancy\nJoint tenancy exists if two or more persons are joint and equal owners of the same undivided\ninterest in real property. Generally, to establish a joint tenancy a fourfold unity must exist:\ninterest, title, time, and possession. Joint tenants have the same interest, acquired by the same\nconveyance, commencing at the same time, and held by the same possession.7\nThe most important characteristic of a joint tenancy is the right of survivorship that flows from\nthe unity of interest. The words \"with the right of survivorship\" are not necessary for a valid joint\ntenancy deed, although they are often inserted. If one joint tenant dies, the surviving joint tenant\n(or tenants) become(s) the owner(s) of the property to the exclusion of the heirs or devisees of\nthe deceased. Thus, joint tenancy property cannot be disposed of by the last will and testament, is\nnot subject to intestate succession, and typically does not become part of the estate of a joint\ntenant subject to probate.\nCreating A Joint Tenancy\nWith limited exception, California appellate courts have accepted and enforced the common law\nrule that if any one of the four unities \u2014 time, title, interest or possession \u2014 is lacking, a tenancy\nin common, not a joint tenancy, exists. An exception to the general rule has been more recently\napplied in connection with the time of acquisition of the title to the property. Consultation with\nknowledgeable legal counsel is recommended to answer questions that may be posed by property\nowners regarding the establishment of joint tenancies and the legal, practical, tax, estate\nplanning, and other considerations involved.\n 4 See Civil Code Section 682. 5 See Civil Code Section 685. 6 See Probate Code Section 6400 et seq. 7 See Civil Code Section 683.\nReal Property Ownership and Deed Recording\n4\nHowever, by statute a joint tenancy may be created:8\n1. By transfer from a sole owner to himself or herself and others as joint tenants.\n2. By transfer from tenants in common to themselves or to themselves, or any of them, and\nothers as joint tenants.\n3. By transfer from joint tenants to themselves, or to any of them, or to others as joint\ntenants.\n4. By transfer from a husband and wife (when holding title as community property or\notherwise) to themselves, or to themselves and others, or to one of them and to another or\nothers as joint tenants.\n5. By transfer to executors of an estate or trustees of a trust as joint tenants.","output":"Joint, common, or community ownership refers to the simultaneous ownership of a property by two or more individuals. There are two types of co-ownership interests: tenancy in common and joint tenancy. Tenancy in common exists when several individuals own undivided interests in a property, and no right of survivorship exists for individual tenants. The undivided interest of a deceased tenant passes to the beneficiaries through probate or intestate succession. Joint tenancy, on the other hand, exists when two or more individuals are joint and equal owners of the same undivided interest in a property, with a right of survivorship. This means that if one joint tenant dies, the surviving joint tenant becomes the owner of the property, and the property cannot be disposed of by the last will and testament or subject to intestate succession. To establish a joint tenancy, a unity of interest, title, time, and possession must exist. However, if any of these unities are lacking, a tenancy in common exists. Joint tenancy may be created by transfer from a sole owner, tenants in common, joint tenants, husband and wife, or executors of an estate or trustees of a trust as joint tenants."}

{"instruction":"","input":"CHAPTER EIGHTEEN\n Special Conditions\n From Jeremy\nI find this material fascinating but you don\u2019t have to read it unless you have one of the headlined conditions. This is an effort to give some help to people with serious conditions who are likely to need medical help, or at least some level of medical supervision as well as \u201cbook help.\u201d \nThere are some more extreme or special conditions causing back pain for which you are going to want to receive individual guidance from a physician but for which you may also get substantial help from the book. Here and elsewhere, you may ask: If I have to go to a therapist for this anyway, why not leave it all to him or her? The answer is twofold. First, the concepts and exercises in the book will give you a great foundation on which to build the more specific treatments suggested by your caregiver. But, second, in my experience, too many therapists treating these conditions jump right into the specific exercises and stretches for these conditions without building an adequate foundation of spine health and strength. That\u2019s what this book does. \nSo . . . get started with this book and then seek out specific treatment. But be alert: Some of these exercises can exacerbate pain for some sufferers. If that happens to you, stop. Sorry that this is so complicated. You are almost always going to get substantial help from the general advice you have already read but\u2014for these special conditions\u2014you will also benefit from the specific advice in this chapter. See your doctor and strike your own balance between medical help and the advice we offer here. It is a two-sided approach and\u2014often with these special conditions\u2014both can help. Typically, the medical help alone\u2014great relief though it may be\u2014is not going to provide a complete, permanent solution. \nDisc Herniations\nThis means a burst disc and it is very serious business, as you already know. You should start by seeing a medical doctor. If a doctor has told you that you should try conservative (that is, nonintrusive) care for a herniated disc but you are in too much pain to start this book, you may benefit from a steroid injection to calm the pain down. I am slow to recommend that step, but this may be one of the situations where it makes sense. Sometimes an injection can bring the pain and inflammation down to a tolerable level so that rehab exercises can be undertaken. You should be warned that steroid injections can slow the healing process of a herniated disc. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of a steroid injection.\nIf you are having pain down your leg from a herniated disc, something called nerve flossing can sometimes help. It may sound like a joke, but it is not. Nerve flossing is a technique that attempts to traction or \u201cscrub\u201d the nerve roots as they exit the spinal cord near the herniated disc to remove material that sometimes builds up on them. If there is \u201cstuff\u201d stuck to the nerve roots or nerves (it is likely to be either pieces of disc material or scar tissue), that \u201cstuff\u201d can cause or exacerbate pain, and removing it can help a lot. Nerve flossing can sometimes do precisely that and provide significant relief. Caution: This technique can sometimes cause an increase in pain initially, before it reduces it. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t work. But it works enough to be worth the shot. There are countless YouTube videos out there on this subject. My favorite approach is Dr. Stuart McGill\u2019s. He has various videos and describes his approach in detail in his books. \nHypermobile Sacroiliac (SI) Joint Pain\nThis pain can be one of the most difficult and stubborn conditions to treat, in my experience. The sacroiliac, or \u201cSI,\u201d joint is the joint in your pelvis where the sides of your pelvis connect with your sacrum. \nThe SI joint is not supposed to move very much in a healthy individual. It is crossed by large ligaments and muscles that keep it taut. SI joints that move too much can cause recurring episodes of severe pain. This commonly starts with a sprain of these ligaments from a hard fall to the buttocks or from giving birth. Once the ligaments are deformed, the SI joint can become unstable. Learning to engage the core and gluteal muscles at the appropriate times can help people with chronic SI pain. \nA medical intervention is sometimes needed. One approach is prolotherapy, an injection therapy whose goal is to tighten up loose ligaments and stabilize joints. An irritant is injected around the SI joint to cause scarring and stiffening of the ligaments that cross the joint, resulting in a more stable joint. In my experience, this works slightly more than 50 percent of the time. Try this book first and see how much relief you get. You will likely get significant relief. If not, consult several prolotherapy practitioners before deciding to try it. \nBefore considering prolotherapy, try these exercises in addition to the ones you\u2019ve already learned.\nIsometric Adduction \nThe goal here is to strengthen the muscles on the insides of your legs without moving the unstable SI joint. You will need a medicine ball, thick pillow, or something similar for this exercise.\n\nStep 1: Lie on your back with your knees bent. Put the medicine ball between your knees. \nStep 2: Find your neutral spine and brace your core.\nStep 3: Squeeze the ball between the knees with 50 percent strength, being careful not to lose your core brace. Hold for ten seconds.\nStep 4: Repeat ten reps. Do two to three sets. \nIsometric Abduction\nAs with the previous exercise, the goal is to avoid moving the unstable SI joint. The difference here is that you are working on the muscles on the outside of your hips. You will need tubing or an elastic band for this exercise.\nStep 1: Lie on your back with your knees bent. \nStep 2: Find neutral spine and brace your core.\n\nStep 3: Wrap the band or tube around your thighs and below the knees.\n\nStep 4: Engage your glutes and move your knees outward about 45 degrees.\nStep 5: Hold ten seconds.\nStep 6: Do ten reps, two to three sets.\n\u201cBicycles\u201d on Your Side\nThis exercise is very challenging to do properly. One of the goals is to keep your leg in the same \u201chorizontal plane\u201d throughout. By this I mean not to let your leg wander up or down if you were viewing it from the side. Rather, keep it steady with the knee and foot in the same position relative to each other throughout the movement.\nStep 1: Lie on your side with your top arm on the floor in front of you for support.\nStep 2: Brace your core.\n\nStep 3: With the movement of bicycle pedaling in mind, raise your top knee up toward your torso and then push the foot out in front of you. Then bring it back behind you to make a big circle at the hip, as if you were pedaling a bicycle on your side. As you bring the leg behind you, focus on engaging the glutes and opening up the front of the hip.\n\nStep 4: Go only as far as you can without moving your back. \nStep 5: Do ten reps. \nStep 6: Then, go the opposite direction. \nStep 7: Push your heel back behind you, engaging the glutes and stretching out your hip flexors as your foot goes behind you. \nStep 8: While moving the leg, do not let it wander up or down. In other words, stay in the same horizontal plane the entire time. \nBulging Disc\nMost bulging discs will heal on their own if pressures are taken off and the bulging disc is given the chance to recover. The most important thing with a bulging disc is to stop irritating it. You will need to limit activities that put the most pressure on the disc. This means doing much less of any activity that involves a seated position (driving, flying, etc.) as well as picking things up with a rounded back and twisting with the low back (golf, tennis, etc.). There are ways to continue to play these sports without twisting or bending the low back. Remember the concept of creep when you are required to sit. Break it up into twenty- to thirty-minute increments if you are required to sit all day. Avoiding creep is even more urgent when you have a bulging disc.\nFor some people, \u201cpress-ups\u201d can help with bulging disc pain. These were initially recommended by Dr. Joseph McKenzie in his McKenzie protocol. His idea was that this exercise helps to shift the disc back into its natural position. \nPress-Ups\nI have seen some people, but certainly not all people, benefit from this. But it is worth a try.\nStep 1: Lie facedown on the floor with your elbows bent and your arms flat on the floor on either side of you, palms down.\nStep 2: Lightly brace your core. \n\nStep 3: Here\u2019s the hard part: You are going to attempt to press your upper body up off the floor without using the muscles in your low back. Your arms should be doing all of the work and your low back should be relaxed. If you have a bulging disc and you start to lift your torso up with your back muscles, there\u2019s a good chance they will go into spasm and make things quite a bit worse. \n\nStep 4: Very slowly and very carefully, start to push your upper body up off the floor. If your low back muscles kick in, stop and slowly \nlower yourself back to the floor to start again.\nStep 5: Continue up slowly. Go only as high as you can without your back muscles kicking in and without pain. Hold for ten seconds.\nStep 6: Slowly lower yourself back to the starting position using only your arms. Repeat five to ten reps. These can be done daily. \nStenosis\nSevere stenosis can be a serious problem and you may need medical help. But it is also true that often the things we have taught you so far will help quite a lot. Indeed, they may be an answer, so it is worth a try. We do not hold out the promise of an 80 percent success rate with severe stenosis, but the chances of success are substantial and well worth a try. Cases of mild to moderate stenosis typically respond very well to the approaches presented in this book.\nThe process will seem familiar now. Primarily, it is just a matter of finding (and maintaining) your neutral spine so that the irritation can die down. Once you feel comfortable with neutral spine, start to try walking again. For most people with stenosis, walking for moderate distances can be a problem. Make sure to keep your neutral spine and swing your arms from the shoulders as we talked about earlier. In addition, stop and take breaks and sit down before the pain starts. Eventually try to increase the distance you can go between sitting breaks. With increased fitness and endurance in the core muscles, these times between sitting will get longer and longer. Again, I caution that if you have very severe stenosis, you may be one of the relatively few who need surgery. This is especially true if you have leg symptoms and\/or weakness. That said, I have seen countless patients whose MRIs showed moderate to severe stenosis (lateral or central) who were able to get back to a low level of pain and high level of function without surgery. So it is worth a shot. \nFor many with lateral or central stenosis, bicycling can be a great way to get exercise and relieve the back, because of the forward-bent posture when on a bike. Another solution is to do the following stretch to relieve the discomfort caused by stenosis. \nStenosis Relief Stretch\nThis stretch is the knee-to-chest stretch for relief from stenosis. It is pretty simple and often effective.\n\nStep 1: Lie on your back.\nStep 2: Lightly engage your core.\nStep 3: Slowly bring your knees up toward your chest and grab your knees with your hands, pulling your knees into the chest.\nStep 4: Hold and breathe for thirty seconds. \nStep 5: Repeat five to ten times. This can be done throughout the day.\nScoliosis\nIf you have scoliosis, it is important to see a good physical therapist to get exercises prescribed for your specific body. One size does not fit all on this one, so we cannot handle it definitively in this book. Your therapist should take into account the degree of curvature you have in your spine and the cause of your scoliosis and prescribe treatment accordingly. For instance, scoliosis caused by a leg length discrepancy will sometimes respond to orthotics. Severe scoliosis might require a brace. There are various exercises and stretches to apply depending on your body. I recommend getting personal help from a skilled therapist while also embarking on the protocol presented in this book. \nPregnancy \nBack pain during pregnancy is extremely common. This is because of a host of factors including weight gain, hormonal changes, stress, and lack of sleep. It is a great idea, if you can manage it, to practice all of the advice in this book before you get pregnant and during the early stages of pregnancy. I quite understand that you have a lot on your mind during this period (when I wrote this, Michelle and I were less than a month away from having our first child), but doing these exercises will be a substantial blessing during pregnancy and after. Add it to the list. \nHaving made that boast, I have to admit that you will likely struggle with back pain to some extent no matter what you do. But the back pain will be a lot less. One of the reasons you get back pain in pregnancy is wonderfully logical: It is the release of the hormone relaxin. It is released into your body to prepare for the birth by causing the ligaments in and around the pelvis to loosen, which is a great idea if you are about to deliver a baby, but it also leads to instability in the spine and pelvis, and causes pain. It\u2019s a trade-off: It makes the actual delivery easier, but it causes some pain. The more stable and strong you are going into pregnancy, the better your chances of avoiding back pain. But there is this overriding bit of good advice: Regular exercise throughout pregnancy, including many of the exercises in this book (with light weight) can be done safely and will help a lot with back pain. Talk to your doctor about which exercises are safe for you and how much weight you can safely lift in each stage of pregnancy. You might want to bring this book to your doctor\u2019s appointment for guidance on whether the basic exercises are safe for you. \nIs all this worth it, just for the relatively short term of a pregnancy? Yes. First, it is not a short term, not if you are in serious back pain. And pregnancy is tough enough without the added burden of back pain. So give the preceding advice some thought. At some point you may have flare-ups of back pain, no matter what you do. At that point, you may want to find a good chiropractor and\/or acupuncturist to help you. But find a good one, one who has had lots of experience treating pregnant women. Follow my general advice about finding such professionals. Then ask specific questions about your particular needs and concerns of their office manager when looking to make an appointment. \nOkay, that\u2019s it for these most demanding \u201cspecial situations.\u201d But I have seen this advice do a lot of good for those in these situations and felt compelled to include it. Again, it is \u201cblended advice\u201d: Use the book and see a medical or other specialized healer. And it may not give total relief, but there is a good chance that it will help a lot. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for.","output":"CHAPTER EIGHTEEN: Special Conditions\n\nIn this chapter, the author provides guidance for individuals who suffer from more extreme or special conditions causing back pain. The author emphasizes that while seeking medical help is necessary for these conditions, the book's concepts and exercises can provide a great foundation for building a more specific treatment plan.\n\nThe chapter begins by discussing disc herniations, a severe condition that requires medical attention. The author suggests that if the pain is too severe to start with the book, a steroid injection may be necessary to calm the pain down. Nerve flossing is also recommended to remove disc material or scar tissue that can cause or exacerbate pain.\n\nNext, the author addresses hypermobile sacroiliac (SI) joint pain, which can be one of the most challenging and stubborn conditions to treat. In addition to medical intervention, the author recommends isometric adduction and abduction exercises to strengthen the muscles without moving the unstable SI joint.\n\nThe author concludes by reminding readers to strike a balance between medical help and the advice provided in the book. The two-sided approach can provide significant relief for individuals with these special conditions, and seeking specific treatment after building a foundation with the book's exercises can lead to a complete, permanent solution."}

Here are some common reasons that can cause a `NullReferenceException`:\n\n1. Not initializing a variable: If you try to access a variable that hasn't been initialized, it will throw a `NullReferenceException`. Make sure that you initialize all variables before using them.\n2. Not setting a reference to an object: If you are trying to access an object that has not been set, Unity will throw a `NullReferenceException`. Check that you have assigned a valid reference to the object you are trying to access.\n3. Not using `GetComponent()` properly: When you use `GetComponent()` to access a component on a game object, it can return `null` if the component doesn't exist on the object. Make sure you check if the component is `null` before trying to access it.\n4. Not checking for `null` before using a reference: Always check if a reference is `null` before using it. This is especially important if the reference is coming from another object or script.\n5. Trying to access a destroyed object: If you try to access an object that has been destroyed, Unity will throw a `NullReferenceException`. Make sure you check if the object is null or has been destroyed before trying to access it.\n6. Using a `GameObject` instead of a `Transform`: If you are trying to access a component of a `GameObject`, make sure you use `GetComponent()` on the `GameObject`'s `Transform` component.\n\nTo fix a `NullReferenceException`, you need to find out which object or variable is causing the error and then make sure that it is properly initialized or set. You can use Unity's Debugging tools like Debug.Log or Visual Studio Debugger to identify the specific line of code that is causing the error."}
{"instruction":"","input":"Make this into an introduction to a chapter of a tabletop RPG book.\nSo basically I'm on a kick of seeing if I can write a space opera\/optimistic space adventure setting with zero supernaturalism of any kind that's 100% about sentients' agency. And it's wild how hard this is actually to do and how much theology and supernaturalism are in \\*most\\* modern sci fi. \n\nStar Trek, often seen as one of the more atheist of sf franchises, interestingly has tons of this - possession, godlike aliens (regardless of whether people choose to worship them), ancient astronauts, and the premise that some species' religions refer to things that are objectively real rather than a matter of faith. \n\nNothing has made me realize most popular media sci fi has supernaturalism and theology in it (including and especially your favorite shows and movies written by professed atheists), like trying to worldbuild an s\/f setting that \\*doesn't\\* have a lot of that and retains a fair amount of human responsibility for human consequences.\n\n (One of the things in my setting bible is that I want problems to be solved by collective sentient effort and personal responsibility \\*most\\* of the time, and alien intervention in our history to play very little role. Humans collectively are the cause of most of our own failures and successes. This actually wipes tons of popular tropes off the board right away and is trickier to write than you can imagine!)\n\nAnd almost all popular media sci fi has huge elements of supernaturalism and theology. (though hilariously, Star Wars \\*only\\* asks audiences to accept the existence of space wizards, which actually makes it one of the least supernaturalist of the various popular sf franchises.)\n\nPast the 70s, tons of media sci fi goes the direction of \"Gods are real but they're actually sufficiently advanced aliens that we only worship because we don't understand them.\" Which is an interesting stance but after a while it still boils down to \"theological premises are objectively real rather than a matter of personal faith.\"\n\nAlso given I'm couching my own thing in the visual language and themes of retrofuture, it really makes me realize that somehow the supernatural themes as well as \"can't show humans having too much collective or even realistic agency\" in sci fi actually \\*stepped up\\* after the 70s. How and why did that happen? When did it stop being a thing to portray human agency let alone collective agency? \n\nAs of the 80s, harder stuff that doesn't go theological, has a tendency to be somewhat grimdark (cautionary tales offering no solutions; there is no way out of the exploitation and human-wrought horror being portrayed, except perhaps for - in the case of cyberpunk - doing crime. But the system of oppression must always be portrayed as intractable and oppression and inequality are always destiny. Sometimes 80s works got a little more hopeful, but I want to see more of life AFTER the revolution.)\n\n Even Asimov (whose work was more grounded and human affirming up to this point) began tying up his narratives and explaining them away so that we're all pawns in the schemes of more powerful beings - by the time we get to his much later work, little of what his human characters achieved in his earlier works even really matters anymore in the same way that it did before I knew that super-robots moved pieces into place, and time-cops had already decided how things would go. \n\nWhy did this kind of theme take over sci fi after the 70s? When did that slippage actually happen? \n\nWhat happened in the zeitgeist to make that happen? It's like theological arguments just unconsciously slipped in and became a big norm in media sci fi. And tons of atheist franchise writers seem to construct worlds in which godlike beings \\*do\\* exist.","output":"Welcome to the world of [RPG name]!

{"instruction":"","input":"This is the third content. Also, provide me with the headings of the third content.\nI only want you to reply \"acknowledged\" to remember the third content. I will give you the next content after you acknowledge the third content. \nWhat's the difference between arbitration and mediation?\nArbitration and mediation are two very different processes that allow parties to resolve disputes outside of court. Mediation involves a facilitated negotiation, whereas arbitration involves a third party decision maker.\n\nWhat is mediation?\nMediation is an alternative dispute resolution process where the parties engage in negotiation to resolve the issues in dispute. An independent third party, the mediator, will assist the parties to identify the key issues in dispute and consider options and alternatives to settle the matter.\n\nMediation can be voluntary, court ordered or required as part of a dispute resolution clause in a contract.\n\nThe mediator acts as an independent third party who facilitates the discussion between the disputing parties. They will explain how the mediation will take place, identify the real issues in dispute by asking questions to the parties and help develop options to resolve the dispute.\n\nIn most mediations, the parties will be physically separated - as in, they will sit in different rooms, with the mediator speaking with one party at a time, shuffling between parties through the course of the mediation.\n\nAs an independent third party, the mediator can provide innovative solutions that the parties may not have considered prior to the mediation. However, they will not give advice, take sides or make decisions.\n\nIn commercial disputes, and depending on the size of the matter, mediators are often retired judges or other senior lawyers.\n\nA mediation usually occurs over the space of a single day. However the parties are able to adjourn a mediation and reconvene on another date if they agree that it may result in a resolution.\n\nWhat are the advantages of mediation?\nSome of the key advantages of mediation include:\n\nit is much less formal and more cost effective than arbitration or litigation;\nit is confidential;\nthe parties can offer creative settlements that go beyond usual monetary offers. This allows both parties to make offers that protect their commercial interests which can facilitate a win\/win outcome;\ncompared with litigation or arbitration, it is extremely inexpensive;\nit happens over a relatively short space of time.\nEven where mediation does not resolve the matter, the process can clarify the issues in dispute which will help keep costs down if the matter goes to arbitration or litigation.\n\nMediation may not be suitable where the commercial relationship has broken down and there is a real sense that one of the parties is not willing to negotiate.\n\nThe obvious disadvantage with mediation is that it's not guaranteed to produce an outcome. It depends on both parties being willing to negotiate, and their ability to reach an agreement that will be acceptable to both of them.\n\nWhat is arbitration?\nArbitration is a process of dispute resolution where an independent adjudicator makes a binding decision on the issues in contention based on the evidence presented by the parties. \n\nIn a practical sense, arbitration is quite similar to litigation - except that arbitrations are conducted outside of court.\n\nArbitration usually arises as a result of a dispute resolution clause in a contract. It can also arise where the parties voluntarily decide to go to arbitration (for example, to keep the matter private).\n\nThe arbitrator is chosen by agreement between the parties. If the parties are unable to agree on a specific arbitrator, they will often agree on an independent person or body to appoint the arbitrator. \n\nUnlike mediation, arbitration has a more structured and formal process. For example, in arbitration:\n\nthere is a hearing, just like in a court case;\nthere can be a lengthy pre-trial process, involving pleadings, discovery and the preparation of written witness statements;\nparties may be cross examined during the trial;\nthe arbitrator will usually issue a detailed written decision after the hearing.\nAn arbitral decision can normally be registered in court, and then enforced like a court judgement. There are circumstances where an arbitrator's decision can be appealed, however this will sometimes depend on the nature of the error involved.\n\nAlthough the arbitration is very similar to litigation, arbitration offers a more flexible and efficient process. It can often be finalised in a much shorter time frame than litigation.\n\nArbitrators have a legal background and will usually have expertise in the area that is the subject of the dispute. The arbitrator will decide:\n\nhow the process will run (although often the parties will agree be bound by specific arbitration rules, such as the Resolution Institute Arbitration Rules; and\nthe outcome of the dispute.\nWhat are the advantages of arbitration?\nSome of the key advantages of arbitration include:\n\nunlike mediation, it is certain to result in a resolution of the dispute. This is because there will be a final binding award made by an independent third party; \nit is sometimes more efficient and cost effective than litigation;\nunlike litigation, arbitration remains confidential; and\nthe process is flexible and can sometimes be determined by the parties.\nWhile arbitration can sometimes be cheaper than litigation, often it will end up costing roughly the same. The parties will still have to pay legal fees (and usually the other party's fees if they are unsuccessful), the adjudicator\u2019s fees and other incidental costs (such as transcript fees and room hire costs).\n\nDepending on the nature of the dispute, it is rare for a commercial arbitration to be concluded in less than 6 months. At the same time, it is not uncommon for an arbitration to run for more than a year (just like litigation).\n\nArbitration can provide an effective means of resolving a dispute where mediation or negotiation has failed, and where the parties would prefer for the dispute to be kept outside the public domain.","output":"Acknowledged.

{"instruction":"","input":"How to use FastAPI code to write the response text to github account in a repo named picas-mod in a folder which is timestamped and response text is written inside the folder as .tf files","output":"To write the response text to a GitHub repository using FastAPI, you will need to use the GitHub API and the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to the API. Here is an example of how you can do this:\n\n1. First, install the `requests` library using `pip install requests`.\n2. Import the `requests` library and FastAPI in your code:\n```\nimport requests\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\n```\n1. Obtain a personal access token for your GitHub account, which will be used to authenticate the API requests. You can generate a personal access token by going to your GitHub settings and selecting \"Developer Settings\" > \"Personal access tokens\".\n2. Initialize the FastAPI app and define a route that will handle the API request:\n```\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.post(\"\/write-to-github\")\ndef write_to_github(response: str):\n    # your code here\n    pass\n```\n1. In the route handler function, use the `requests` library to make a `POST` request to the GitHub API to create a new file in the repository. The API endpoint for creating a file is `https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/{OWNER}\/{REPO}\/contents\/{PATH}`, where `{OWNER}` is the username of the repository owner, `{REPO}` is the name of the repository, and `{PATH}` is the path to the file in the repository.\n2. To create a new file, you will need to pass the following parameters in the request body:\n* `path`: the path to the file, including the filename and extension\n* `message`: a commit message describing the change\n* `content`: the content of the file, encoded as a base64 string\n\nHere is an example of how you can construct the request body and make the API call:\n```\nimport base64\n\n# create the path to the file, including the timestamp and .tf extension\ntimestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")\npath = f\"picas-mod\/{timestamp}\/response.tf\"\n\n# encode the response text as a base64 string\ncontent = base64.b64encode(response.encode()).decode()\n\n# construct the request body\ndata = {\n    \"path\": path,\n    \"message\": \"Add response text\",\n    \"content\": content\n}\n\n# make the API call\nheaders = {\n    \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {TOKEN}\"\n}\nresponse = requests.post(\n    f\"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/{OWNER}\/{REPO}\/contents\/{path}\",\n    json=data,\n    headers=headers\n)\n```\n1. If the API call is successful, it will return a `201 Created` status code and the response will contain information about the newly created file. You can access the content of the file by making a `GET` request to the API endpoint `https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/{OWNER}\/{REPO}\/contents\/{PATH}` and decoding the `content` field in the response.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."}

We would like to come up with ideas on how to encourage our agents to develop better rapport with our customers. We would like to challenge our agents to develop great conversations with the customers on various topics and develop rapport, and we will reward the agents for successful interactions. Please provide us 5 ideas on to achieve that.","output":"1. Encourage your agents to ask open-ended questions: Asking open-ended questions (i.e. questions that cannot be answered with just a \"yes\" or \"no\" response) can help to encourage more in-depth conversations with customers and help to build rapport. For example, instead of asking \"Did you have a good experience at the casino today?\", an agent could ask \"What did you enjoy most about your visit to the casino today?\"\n2. Provide training on active listening: Encourage your agents to really listen to the customer and show that they are interested in what the customer has to say. This can be done through nonverbal cues such as nodding and making eye contact, as well as through verbal responses like paraphrasing and asking clarifying questions.\n3. Encourage your agents to be personable: Encourage your agents to be friendly and approachable, and to make an effort to connect with the customer on a personal level. This could involve finding common interests or experiences to talk about, or simply showing genuine interest and care for the customer's experience.\n4. Encourage your agents to use positive language: Encourage your agents to use positive, upbeat language when interacting with customers. This can help to create a positive atmosphere and make the customer feel more at ease.\n5. Provide opportunities for your agents to practice their conversational skills: Consider setting up role-playing exercises or other training activities that allow your agents to practice their conversational skills and build rapport with customers.

{"instruction":"","input":"ENTRY 2 \n\nVal's Early Life\n\n\\*\\*\n\nStaying alive, I suppose you\u2019d say that was my preoccupation, the Co-Op may as well have been my mother and father, and the options were that, or something worse. And spending my first few years in a firetrap tenement of a human district at Three Points East, I knew what \u201cworse\u201d looked like. \n\nSo you take ratings. Wash, rinse, repeat. I was always good at math, and fixing things, and managed to pick up a couple of local languages, like Tradetongue and Novayan - most of all I knew what streets to stay off of on my walk back from the market, and what not to wear in case I couldn\u2019t stay off those streets. \n\nThen after Mama died, and we moved up to Perimeter One (where my grandmother lived), things changed. The big space station was lonely and austere much of the time but it was safe. It\u2019s a lonely childhood but it\u2019s not like you know better, because pretty much any other human children, doing the same thing, taking their Early ratings, sitting in the atrium by themselves while mom\u2019s giving out tools at the station depot. But sometimes during Landing Day or Mars Day or Yuri\u2019s Night it turns into a weeklong party, an inversion festival if you will. \n\nAnd that\u2019s how I found out, that whatever station I happened to be at, there were other parts of the station. On Perimeter One, I would walk, and take the freight lift down to the Nadiran quarter. There it was clean, and quiet, and everybody usually just went about their thing. I strained to listen to their language and learned quickly to duck behind a pylon before I was seen. They leaned over in their dark robes, speaking barely above a whisper, making deals, and after straining my eyes I learned to pick up a bit of the hand signs they used in their haggling. \n\nI rated onto my first Massive Container Transport at 16, as a trainee. That\u2019s when people started calling me \u201cSparks,\u201d not once in that whole trip did anyone remember my name. I thought stationside would be different with cred on my stick, no such luck.\n\nI tried to hook up in port a few times, wanted to see what all the fuss was about, turns out alcohol can make anything happen. Mostly though I just didn\u2019t know how to pass the time after the depots and library branches were closed. Didn\u2019t know what to do with company anyway, so mostly in port I just laid low. \n\nBut\u2026 I just\u2026 nothing ever really happened, not at any stop, year after year; somehow it\u2019s like I was standing on the sidelines, my syndics all shuffled off to their families and friends. None of that had happened for me, somehow whatever it was when we were on the ship, disappeared in port. \n\nSo at 20, when I had the chance to rate in ansible and work a ringship between the Destruction system and the Port West system, I took it. That\u2019s why I became an intersystem spacer, because I was already out of sync anyway, had no family, had no one. Time loss wouldn\u2019t mean a thing to me, nobody knew I was alive. Some Light Chasers get addicted to the feeling of\u2026 when I get back, how badly will shit have changed. Some of us just love that every time we get back, the food\u2019s better than whatever we left behind. A few months to us, but meanwhile, downworld they\u2019ve had years to get their shit together. \n\nNot like any sensible person with a family would ever make a life of this. It\u2019s not just a way to run away from your problems, nobody downworld wants to deal with it. One or two trips, that\u2019s one thing: especially when you\u2019re young. But you pick the life of the Light Chaser, for any length of time, because you got no family to begin with, and you don\u2019t want one.\n\nMay as well see the next system over, right? Get me further away from the hole in the wall called Three Points East. I never thought much about the future. That had something to do with settling down in the communes and raising seaweed or something, whenever anyone talks about \u201cthe future of the Co-Op\u201d they\u2019re always talking about the people raising rugrats on AgCom 5 or something. People on the ground, they think about the future. For me, the future is happening whether I want to think about it or not. No time to think about it.\n\nAs a kid I was good at just a few things, staying out of the way and studying, and fending for myself, and not complaining. Above all, don\u2019t complain. They won\u2019t hear it. If you think this life ain\u2019t much then it\u2019s still an RCH better than joining a gang on Three Points East, or selling your body, or being a drug mule on Port West. If you\u2019re a smart kid then this is your best chance at an actual life. Maybe even you put your feet dirtside and have a family. Your grandparents broke their bodies as asteroid miners to give you this, and shed blood to give you this. Your great grandfather or great grandmother stayed in a crimp on some hellhole station, just to get abducted away by corporate sleeper ship and cross light years in cold storage. All so you could have this, in relative safety, the routines are what they are, and so your own children (figuratively speaking) could do better still. Could always be much worse. \n\nYou could be on Earth. And in my years since, I learned there are places even worse, that make Earth look like a garden spot. Suffice it to say, seeing what I\u2019ve seen since, I might take Earth over any of them.\nENTRY 3\n\nSo the thing about long distance transport is that it\u2019s one of the best places to be a trainee. It\u2019s got the most opportunities for rating and cross-training. You\u2019re probably not gonna die too messily. If it\u2019s a Massive Container Transport going between systems, you see the most people, and it\u2019s still one of the least cramped of the ships in ItSyn\u2019s complement, let alone the Co-Op\u2019s as a whole. (An MCT is a belly-lander, detachable from its modular ring drive, but that\u2019s beside the point.) This make and model of MCT, a second-generation, is the newest and cleanest and has the best filtration, and the most space. On a smaller ship, you\u2019re smelling each other\u2019s sweaty asscracks all day. MCTs on the other hand just kind of always smell like hand cleaner and engine grease. MCTs are the smoothest ride, the newest components. \nThe Intersystem Transport Syndicate has the best facilities, the best security. You can license your own ship and run a commercial service under the auspices of the Co-Op, sure, but on a lot of things you\u2019re just gonna be on your own. And that\u2019s how lots of people like it.\nBut you gotta get from here to there, and if you\u2019re from Three Points East like me, then the extra cred working for ItSyn is how you get there. The MCTs have the best facilities, with two big hab rings for in-system (longest parts of a trip). Before we make jump between systems, you make sure you got your belongings off because we\u2019re going to be leaving the hab rings behind. On we go into the drive frame, we lock in, on goes the A-drive and control units, and then the pre-jump checks before spin up, and that\u2019s a longer procedure than I\u2019m going to bother to walk you through, but everything\u2019s got to be snug and everything\u2019s got to be balanced. Then you take your meds and get into your liquid filled intersystem crash couches. A jump takes absolutely precision usage of fuel, more than any other maneuver, because you don\u2019t want to overshoot your target and plow into a star. Takes a big thrust to spin up, the hardest you\u2019ll pull Gs on any trip short of leaving dirtside. I know you were hoping for some kind of warp drive technobabble, or to hear about monsters or some bullshit. Sorry I can\u2019t make it a better story.\n\nThat\u2019s the hardest part of a jump. It\u2019s not even the spin-up. That happens fast, and smooth. You feel nothing. Nothing even shifts as the ripple in spacetime moves around you and you push through it. Some of my syndics called that part hitting the halfpipe, don\u2019t know where that\u2019s even from.\nJust get in, sit down, shut up, and hang on.\n\\*\\*\nThe best part of an MCT is the privacy. The newer MCT habs have \u201csoundproof\u201d individual compartments with sliding doors, so if your habmates are like mine and always having visitors over, then you\u2019re going to be grateful for that. If the visitor is a certain Novayan, then it\u2019s probably not going to be enough.\nThat Novayan was one K\u2019Ratha, an FNG working in the hold, better known for his sack skills than anything else. He\u2019d come aboard with some other Novayans a month back, but none were as popular as him (there were a couple of quieter males and a grumpy female). K\u2019Ratha made the rounds in my hab multiple times on each leg of the trip, and this was going to be a long one. Apparently he was quite in demand, and the soundproofing wasn\u2019t enough. Ended up just laying with my noise-cancelers on and the pillow over my head. This was going to be a long trip.\nWhen I finally saw him in line in the mess, there was another Novayan with him, and overhearing the conversation between them, I had the impression that our K\u2019Ratha thought his ears and whiskers were gonna buy him some automatic cred on the lanes. The other Novayan \u2013 bigger, with broader shoulders - crossed his arms and glowered down at K\u2019Ratha, shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s rude, K\u2019Ratha,\u201d he said, his voice a shade deeper than the other\u2019s, \u201cTo speak in Novayan in front of the humans. Why do you have to be such a walking stereotype, ay?\u201d\n\u201cRreh. Thanna rrala the,\u201d I said.\nThe bigger Novayan reached up and smacked the back of K\u2019Ratha\u2019s head.\n\u201cI apologize for my brother,\u201d he said, bowing his head slightly.\nNow, I\u2019d never seen this Novayan before, despite the fact that he\u2019d come on with K\u2019Ratha, and was surprised at his aura of general formality.\nThe two Novayans looked similar, bigger though this one was. They both had coppery fur with dark stripes and swirls, and black noses.\nThe patches on the bigger Novayan\u2019s flight suit read NAV SPEC III, and he had a bunch more additional rating patches on his flight suit and various fam candy, and his name patch read R\u2019Kesh.\nI shook my head, and kept moving forward in the line to get my tray, thinking on whatever deal the Co-Op must\u2019ve made with Seven Brothers Aqua to keep this many Novayan crewmates in this much space-farmed salmon.\n\n\\*\\*","output":"It seems like Val had a difficult childhood growing up on a space station. They were often lonely and had to fend for themselves, learning how to navigate the different quarters and how to stay safe. They eventually began working on a Massive Container Transport as a trainee, earning the nickname \"Sparks.\" When they turned 20, they took the opportunity to work on an ansible and become an intersystem spacer, also known as a Light Chaser. It seems like this decision was motivated by a desire to escape their difficult past and the feeling of being disconnected from the rest of society. They also mention that the life of a Light Chaser is not suitable for someone with a family, as it involves long periods of time spent traveling through space and experiencing time dilation."}

that i've ever made my advice to most people is don't go to college read these eight books instead and the reason to not go to college is that if you have the desire to learn you can educate yourself far quicker far cheaper and far more effectively using the internet than you ever can at university and my goal with these eight books is to not just tell you them but to summarize the core idea of each book in less than 60 seconds so that you don't have to read the book unless you really want to book number one is mindset by carol dweck through research carol discovered there are two different types of mindsets that people have and which mindset you have massively determines whether you succeed or fail the first mindset is the fixed mindset which believes that intelligence and skill is fixed having this belief leads to you trying to appear smart instead of trying to actually improve at a certain skill this leads to not wanting to face challenges in case you fail this leads to you trying to avoid criticism because it means that you are not as intelligent as you want to be and it leads to you just not trying as hard as you should which leads to you plateauing and failing at your certain task the opposite mindset is the growth mindset which recognizes that intelligence like most things is a skill that can be learned this leads to you viewing challenges as an opportunity to learn this leads to you trying as hard as possible which obviously increases the likelihood of you succeeding massively book number two extreme ownership by jocko willink jocko was a navy seal and he found that when he was out fighting if he didn't take extreme ownership and responsibility for everything that happened to himself his missions were far more likely to fail and him and his team were more likely to die he recognized that the best mindset for life and war is extreme ownership recognizing that you are where you are because of you and if you want to get to a different place to where you are now that is all down to you you shouldn't expect other people to help you and you can't blame other people and other things for the way your life circumstances are you have to take full responsibility for how everything is and if you combine this with a growth mindset you're already on a great trajectory book number three think and grow rich by napoleon hill i remember when i first read this book i put it away i thought it was so illogical i thought that it didn't make sense but the more life experience i have i realized that there are some incredibly fundamental deep truths in that book about success basically napoleon hill studied the 500 most successful people alive in his time he went and he interviewed them and he saw patterns between all of them patterns that are internal not external patterns such as the thoughts that you have have a huge influence on your external world and oftentimes the external world is just a reflection of your internal world this stuff sounds crazy but in my life the more experience i've had i've started to notice these things to be weirdly accurate don't know if it's fully true that your thoughts directly change the world around you but i definitely can see how your thoughts change your behavior and your behavior changes the world around you if you want to master your inner game read think and grow rich book number four mastery i believe that you should pursue mastery not directly pursue women or money or anything else pursuing mastery is a producer mindset when most people set their goals they think i want a million dollars i want a great girlfriend i want to succeed these things are taken but mastery is recognizing that you have to go out and get so good at a skill that you're able to provide the universe something incredibly valuable and yet incredibly rare mastery teaches you that in order to become great you have to first be an apprentice you have to go through a phase of learning from other people and this is the most important phase for people that are trying to educate themselves instead of going through college to be an apprentice to be a student to learn from everything and anything from anyone and any person above you or below you learn learn learn and you can achieve mastery which will lead to money lead to women lead to everything else that you want book number five the tao of seneca great book core lesson for me was that life is not short it's just that we waste a lot of it and in reality the allotment that we have been given in terms of time is vast if we improve at the skill of using our time incredibly effectively people say life goes by quickly people say that we only have a brief amount of time on this planet those things are true if you have those mindsets but if you believe that you can maximize your life if you get good at being productive you actually have enough time to live multiple lifetimes in this one lifetime live multiple of most other people's lifetimes experience crazy things experience a huge diversity of things in this one lifetime if we get good at using our time wisely book number six linchpin by seth godin basically if you want success you have to get to the point where you can't be replaced if there are other people with the same skill set as you then the person who's going to be employed and the person who's going to get paid is the person who's willing to take the least amount of money because if an employer has two different options both options have the same skill set the employer is going to go for the person that can get paid the least obviously so your goal here is to get so good at something that you can't be replaced that the employer has no option other than to pay you what you're worth and focusing on improving your skills and getting so good that people can't afford to fire you is how you have a long lasting successful career book number seven the millionaire fastlane basically getting rich quick isn't necessarily a scam getting rich easy is a scam but getting rich quick is possible and it's possible by rejecting lots of the mindsets of the middle class which says that you need to save money that you need to invest in low risk funds these things work if you are content with retiring at age 70. if you are not content then there is another option the millionaire fast lane which basically says provide a ton of value solve people's problems at scale which you can do easily now not easily but you can do quickly now thanks to the internet and that's how you can become a millionaire quickly not necessarily slowly and book number eight is the sovereign individual which says that times are changing we're entering a new revolution called the information revolution which births knowledge workers people that use their brain to work and with knowledge workers become incredible leverage where you can make one decision that takes you one minute yet the impact of that decision can impact millions and millions of people as a result of this financial freedom is more and more and more possible for more and more and more people who decide to use their brain to create value and as a result of this countries now are forced to treat people in their country not as prisoners who have to be there but as customers who can choose to leave that country and exert their financial freedom by moving to different places fascinating change of events that is just happening now that if you're one of the first people that start to benefit from this you can really make some cool things happen within your lifetime and that's it i truly believe if you take these eight principles to heart you can provide yourself with a better education than most college degrees\"\nVideo Summary:","output":"The speaker argues that going to college is not necessary for self-education, and that one can learn more quickly, cheaply, and effectively through the internet and by reading certain books. They list eight books that they believe can help someone achieve success and improve their mindset, including \"Mindset\" by Carol Dweck, \"Extreme Ownership\" by Jocko Willink, \"Think and Grow Rich\" by Napoleon Hill, \"Mastery\" by Robert Greene, \"The Tao of Seneca\", \"Linchpin\" by Seth Godin, \"The Millionaire Fastlane\" by MJ DeMarco, and \"The 4-Hour Work Week\" by Timothy Ferriss. The speaker summarizes the core idea of each book in less than 60 seconds and encourages readers to read the books if they want to learn more."}
{"instruction":"","input":"what's the difference or relationship between quantum mechanics, quantum thermodynamics, quantum electrodynamics and quantum information? and what's a quantum field theory?","output":"Quantum mechanics, quantum thermodynamics, quantum electrodynamics, and quantum information are different subfields within the broader field of quantum physics, which studies the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales. Each subfield focuses on a specific aspect of quantum phenomena.\n\n1. Quantum Mechanics:\nQuantum mechanics is the foundational theory of quantum physics, which describes the behavior of particles and systems at the atomic and subatomic level. It is based on the principles of superposition, wave-particle duality, and uncertainty, and uses mathematical tools such as wave functions and probability amplitudes to predict the outcomes of measurements.\n2. Quantum Thermodynamics:\nQuantum thermodynamics is a subfield that aims to extend classical thermodynamics to the quantum domain. It studies the behavior of quantum systems in terms of energy, entropy, and temperature, and explores phenomena such as quantum heat engines, quantum refrigerators, and the thermodynamic behavior of quantum information processing.\n3. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):\nQuantum electrodynamics is a specific type of quantum field theory that deals with the interaction of light (photons) and charged particles, like electrons and positrons. It is a relativistic quantum theory, meaning it accounts for both quantum mechanics and special relativity. QED provides a theoretical framework for understanding electromagnetic processes such as the scattering of light, the emission and absorption of photons, and the behavior of charged particles in magnetic fields.\n4. Quantum Information:\nQuantum information is a subfield that explores the encoding, processing, and transmission of information using quantum systems. It is based on the principles of quantum mechanics and encompasses topics such as quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum cryptography. Quantum information leverages phenomena like quantum entanglement and superposition to develop new techniques for computation and communication that go beyond classical capabilities.\n\nQuantum Field Theory (QFT):\nQuantum field theory is a theoretical framework that combines quantum mechanics and special relativity to describe the behavior of particles and fields at the smallest scales. In QFT, particles are seen as excitations or quanta of underlying fields, such as the electromagnetic field for photons or the electron field for electrons. Quantum electrodynamics (QED), as mentioned earlier, is a specific type of quantum field theory. Other examples of quantum field theories include Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) for the strong nuclear force and the electroweak theory for the unification of the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces."}

It seems that `performer['name']` is a tuple, and you're trying to access the second element using the index `1`. However, tuple indices must be integers or slices, not strings, so this is causing a `TypeError`.\n\nTo fix this error, you can try replacing `performer['name'][1]` with `performer['name'][0]`, which should access the first element of the tuple. Alternatively, you could access the second element of the tuple using `performer['name'][1:]`.\n\nIt's worth noting that the specific solution will depend on the structure of the `performer` object and what you're trying to do with it. It's possible that the `performer['name']` tuple has more than two elements, in which case you may need to access a different index or slice to get the value you want."}

In the Script editor, copy and paste the following code:\n```java\nfunction getShopifyOrders() {\n  var api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY';\n  var password = 'YOUR_API_PASSWORD';\n  var shop_url = 'YOUR_SHOP_URL';\n  \n  var start_date = new Date();\n  start_date.setMonth(start_date.getMonth() - 1);\n  var end_date = new Date();\n  \n  var url = 'https:\/\/' + api_key + ':' + password + '@' + shop_url + '\/admin\/orders.json?created_at_min=' + start_date.toISOString() + '&created_at_max=' + end_date.toISOString() + '&status=any';\n  var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url);\n  var orders = JSON.parse(response.getContentText()).orders;\n  \n  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();\n  sheet.clearContents();\n  sheet.appendRow(['Order ID', 'Customer Name', 'Total', 'Created At']);\n  \n  for (var i = 0; i < orders.length; i++) {\n    var order = orders[i];\n    sheet.appendRow([order.id, order.customer.first_name + ' ' + order.customer.last_name, order.total_price, order.created_at]);\n  }\n}\n```\n1. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY`, `YOUR_API_PASSWORD`, and `YOUR_SHOP_URL` with your actual Shopify API credentials and shop URL.\n2. Run the `getShopifyOrders()` function by clicking on the play button in the toolbar.\n3. You'll be asked to grant permissions for the script to access your Google Sheets account. Follow the prompts and grant the necessary permissions.\n4. Once the script has finished running, you should see a new sheet in your Google Spreadsheet with the orders from the last month.\n\nNote that this script will only retrieve orders with the \"any\" status. If you want to filter by a specific order status, you can modify the `status` parameter in the API URL accordingly.\n\nAlso note that the Shopify API has a rate limit, so if you have a large number of orders, you may need to split the API requests into smaller batches to avoid hitting the rate limit."}

{"instruction":"","input":"- Hey, I'm John Kanell, and today on Preppy Kitchen, we're making a quick and easy black bean soup. So let's get started. First off, grab a medium dutch oven or pot. We're gonna add four tablespoons, or 1\/4 cup, of olive oil right into the pot. Place the pot over a medium heat.\n\n I want my oil to be dancing in the pan, so while it's warming up, I'm gonna just chop one yellow onion. Cut your onion in half and leave the root stem on. Vertical chops, and then switch directions. So easy. If you're working with one big onion, it's about two cups.\n\nI also want 1 1\/2 cups of chopped carrots, so just peel some carrots. You'll want about four medium ones. And give 'em a nice chop. For me, that means cutting the carrots halfway down the middle and then just chopping them up. You'll end up with some half-moons and full moons.\n\n It'll look cute. So cute. The veggies are chopped. The oil is warm. We're gonna add the onion and carrot right into the pot.\n\nGrab a wooden spoon. I'm gonna stir these guys occasionally until they're tender. It'll be about 10 minutes over medium heat. Just get them nice and coated in oil to begin with. There's really not that much prep to do for this recipe, so while they're heating up, let's just get our garlic together.\n\n You'll want four or so cloves of garlic. Just give 'em a good smash to get the skin off, and we're gonna mince them up.\n\nMy onion's translucent and the carrot's pretty tender, so it's time to add the garlic and a lot of spices in. I definitely went over four cloves on this. You know the deal.\n\n Garlic cloves are always like a minimum suggestion. No less, but you can add more. Stir that in. Now we're gonna add one tablespoon of cumin. In you go.\n\n A teaspoon of dried oregano. And by the way, black bean soup is a classic Cuban dish. There were so many amazing Cuban restaurants in Los Angeles where I grew up that this is kind of my, this like a little bit of a recreation of a memory I had.\n\nSo I wouldn't say it's authentic at all, but it's just kind of like the flavors that I love. I'm adding 1\/2 a teaspoon of crushed red pepper for some heat.\n\n 1\/2 a teaspoon of salt. We can add more later if we need. And as an optional little addition, 1\/2 a teaspoon of smoked paprika. You can add whatever spices you want. The soup is really flavorful and delicious, but it accepts spices beautifully, so add all your favorites in, go to town.\n\n You can also find a lot of different variations of the classic recipe. If you are going to Caribbean countries, you'll see different flavors added and so on and so forth. So it's really like a blank canvas that you can add so many things to. Okay, stir that in. It smells so good already.\n\nThis is like, hmm, this is what cooking should be. I'm gonna stir this for about two minutes, stirring constantly so the garlic doesn't burn but does become super fragrant. I'm also blooming those spices in the hot, hot oil and really letting their flavor kinda just explode out of there. Okay. Oops, I forgot one thing.\n\n I'm gonna turn this off.\n\nTake it off heat. We have to drain and rinse all of our black beans. So open those cans up, and let's rinse 'em out. If you have any good suggestions for that bean juice, or aquafaba, you can let me know in the comments.\n\n If these were garbanzo beans or chickpeas, I would totally save that. There's so many good uses for it. But I'm not sure about the black bean stuff. All right, my beans are clean. Back to business.\n\n Back to medium heat.\n\nI'm gonna add my black beans. Four cups of veggie broth. If you wanted to make this non-vegetarian, you could definitely use chicken broth, beef broth, any of your favorites. This smells delicious, but it would taste pretty dull, because we need some acid in here.\n\n I want about 1\/4 cup of fresh lime juice. Squeeze that right in. Ah. All my might. I used to have a little lime press, remember?\n\n Cannot find my squeezer, so a fork will do just fine. Depending on how juicy your lime is in. (bell dings) Depending on how juicier your limes are, you might need a few for 1\/4 cup. Or you could be lucky and get one giant juicy lime, mm. One suggestion, just don't use the bottled lime juice.\n\n Mm-mm, it's not the same. There are a bunch of soups that my mom used to make on repeat when I was little, and a lot of them were finished off with a drizzle of olive oil and a drizzle of vinegar. I feel like it's a really classic way to finish a soup. Gives you a little bit of richness and that nice acidity too.\n\nIf you did that too, let me know.\n\n I just wanna see if it's super common or kind of random. Stir that lime juice in. And now we're gonna bring this to a boil over medium high heat. The soup needs to come together, so we have to break down these flavors and let them infuse into the broth. My soup's come to a boil.\n\n I'm gonna reduce this heat to low, cover it, and let it simmer away.\n\nThe secret to most soups, but especially this one, is the simmer time. It's actually all the spices and flavorings, but the other secret is the simmer time to let those flavors come together. And there's a, even though most of the ingredients are here right now, there's a couple more steps to go just to get every bit of taste and texture outta these ingredients. But for now, we're gonna let the soup simmer away for 25 minutes.\n\n Just remember to stir occasionally. My soup's been bubbling away for a little bit over 25 minutes.\n\nSo now, ooh, so steamy, in the ladle, about two cups right into my blender. This tastes really nice already, but I want a velvety smooth consistency, so. Where's the cups?\n\n (chuckles) There we go, that's about two cups. Open the blender vent. This is so hot, it could just push the top off if the vent isn't open, so leave it open, but maybe just a little bit of coverage. Okay, we're gonna pulse this until it's nice and smooth. And then, we're just gonna pour this back in.\n\nThere we go. And you're gonna let this cook uncovered for 10 to 20 minutes, just so it thickens up even more. Super thick, you want it. (speaks in foreign language) If you want this super thick, closer to 20. More slack, 10 or less.\n\n Before you leave your soup to simmer, it's time for a little taste test. This is where you want to add in any additional seasonings. Hmm. I mean, I really like that, but if you wanted to add some more salt, pepper, lime, whatever else you want to add, this is the time so it has that 10 to 20 minutes just to blend in and release some more flavor. That's good.\n\n Serve topped with avocado, cilantro, and lime, and you're ready to enjoy. That is so good. It's just hearty, comforting. It has wonderful hits of acid and tang, and all the spices coming together with all that cook time. I hope you get a chance to make this recipe.\n\n And if you liked this video, check out my Latin playlist.\n\n(upbeat music).","output":"Hey, I'm John Kanell, and today on Preppy Kitchen, we're making a Quick and Easy Black Bean Soup.

{"instruction":"","input":"How does a nation wide insurance company check DMVs?","output":"Insurance companies can check DMV records in several ways, depending on the state in which the driver is licensed and the laws governing the release of DMV information. Here are a few ways that a nationwide insurance company may check DMV records:\n\n1. Direct access: In some states, insurance companies are allowed direct access to DMV records. This means that the insurance company can log into a secure system to obtain information about a driver's license status, driving record, and any other relevant information.\n2. Third-party vendors: In states where direct access is not allowed, insurance companies may use third-party vendors that specialize in obtaining DMV records. These vendors have access to DMV databases and can provide insurance companies with the information they need to make underwriting decisions.\n3. Electronic verification systems: Some states have electronic verification systems that allow insurance companies to quickly and easily obtain DMV records. These systems are designed to provide insurance companies with the information they need in real-time, without the need for human intervention.\n\nIt's worth noting that the specific methods used by a nationwide insurance company to check DMV records may vary depending on the state in which the driver is licensed and the laws governing the release of DMV information. However, insurance companies are generally able to access DMV records in one way or another in order to make informed underwriting decisions."}

It creates a Cairo context from the Pixmap, sets the source color to the specified RGBA color, moves to the desired pixel coordinate, and then draws a single pixel at that coordinate using the `stroke()` method.\n\nYou can then call this function to draw individual pixels to the Pixmap as needed.\n```\nlet pixmap = gdk::Pixmap::new(None, width, height, 24);\ndraw_pixel(&pixmap, 10, 20, &gdk::RGBA::new(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0));\ndraw_pixel(&pixmap, 20, 30, &gdk::RGBA::new(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0));\n\/\/ etc.\n```\nKeep in mind that this method will be relatively slow if you need to draw a large number of pixels, as it creates a new Cairo context and performs a stroke for each pixel. If you need to draw a large number of pixels, you may want to consider using a different drawing method, such as using the `set_source_pixbuf()` method to draw a whole image at once."}

While it cannot be strictly confined to any particular branch of law, it is often closely associated with constitutional law, particularly in countries with a strong tradition of a written constitution and independent judicial review.\n\nConstitutional law is concerned with the fundamental principles that govern the relationship between the government and the governed, and it is often viewed as the foundation of a nation's legal system. Comparative constitutional law seeks to compare and contrast the constitutional frameworks of different countries, with a view to identifying similarities and differences, best practices, and areas for reform.\n\nFor example, in countries such as the United States, Germany, and India, where there is a strong tradition of written constitutions and judicial review, comparative constitutional law can be a valuable tool for understanding the evolution of constitutional doctrine and the reasoning adopted by judicial forums. By comparing the decisions of constitutional courts in different countries, scholars can identify patterns and trends, and evaluate the relative success of different approaches to constitutional interpretation and application.\n\nMoreover, comparative constitutional law can also help to identify areas where constitutional reform may be necessary or desirable. For example, in countries where the constitution is perceived as outdated or overly restrictive, comparative analysis of other countries' constitutional frameworks may provide insights into possible reform options.\n\nOverall, while comparative public law is a broad field that encompasses many different legal disciplines and areas of inquiry, it is often closely associated with constitutional law, particularly in countries with a strong tradition of a written constitution and independent judicial review.

Shared Interests: Friends often share common interests and hobbies, which can create a strong bond between them. This shared enjoyment can provide a sense of belonging and happiness, just like a romantic relationship can.\n3. Trust and Loyalty: Strong friendships are built on trust and loyalty, just like romantic relationships. Friends can be relied upon to keep secrets, provide honest feedback, and be there for each other through thick and thin.\n4. Longevity: Friendships can often last a lifetime, even when romantic relationships come and go.

In that updated file structure you provided, can you write the PHP code that is OOP and maintainable for Controller.php?","output":"Sure, here is an example of a PHP class for the `Controller` class that uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and is designed to be maintainable and extensible:\n```\nclass Controller\n{\n    protected $model;\n\n    public function __construct($model)\n    {\n        $this->model = $model;\n    }\n\n    public function processRequest($action, $params = [])\n    {\n        if (method_exists($this, $action)) {\n            return $this->$action($params);\n        } else {\n            return $this->index($params);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public function index($params)\n    {\n        \/\/ Default action when no specific action is provided\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this `Controller` class, the `__construct` method is used to inject the model object that will be used by the controller. This allows the controller to access the data and application logic provided by the model. The `processRequest` method is used to handle requests from the user and to dispatch them to the appropriate action method in the controller. If the specified action method does not exist, the `index` method is used as the default action. This allows the controller to be easily extended by adding new action methods as needed, without having to modify the core `Controller` class. Overall, this is a simple and flexible approach to implementing a controller in PHP using OOP principles."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Pretend you are a chemical engineer specializing in chemistry used in anodizing. You are deeply familiar with the anodizing process. What chemistry would you use in the anodizing process?","output":"As a chemical engineer specializing in anodizing, I would recommend using sulfuric acid as the electrolyte in the anodizing process. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid that can dissolve the aluminum oxide layer on the surface of aluminum and create pores that are necessary for anodizing.\n\nThe anodizing process begins with cleaning the aluminum surface to remove any dirt, grease, or oils. Then the aluminum is immersed in the electrolyte solution, which is typically a mixture of sulfuric acid and water. An electrical current is passed through the solution, which causes oxygen to be released at the anode and hydrogen at the cathode. The oxygen reacts with the aluminum surface to form a thick layer of aluminum oxide.\n\nThe thickness of the oxide layer can be controlled by adjusting the voltage and time of the anodizing process. The anodized surface is porous and can be dyed to produce a range of colors or left as is for a natural finish.\n\nIn addition to sulfuric acid, other electrolytes such as oxalic acid or chromic acid can also be used in the anodizing process, but sulfuric acid is the most commonly used electrolyte due to its effectiveness and low cost."}

In a mixing glass, combine the sugar cube (or simple syrup) and bitters.\n2. Add a splash of water and muddle the ingredients together until the sugar has dissolved.\n3. Add the whiskey to the mixing glass and stir to combine.\n4. Fill a rocks glass with ice and strain the mixture over the ice.\n5.

To properly muddle the ingredients, use a muddler or the back of a spoon to press down on the ingredients in the mixing glass until they are well combined and the sugar has dissolved. You can use simple syrup instead of a sugar cube in an old fashioned, but it may change the flavor and texture slightly. Simply syrup is a liquid form of sugar that is easier to mix into the cocktail."}

Material selection is critical for MEMS devices as the properties of the material used can affect their performance, reliability, and cost. Ashby's approach is a systematic method for material selection that considers the desired properties of the material and the constraints on the design.\n\nIn the context of MEMS sensors and transducers, the desired properties include high sensitivity, low noise, and good stability. The constraints include the need for miniaturization, compatibility with semiconductor processing, and low power consumption. The material selection process involves identifying materials with the desired properties and evaluating their compatibility with the design constraints.\n\nSilicon is a commonly used material for MEMS devices due to its excellent mechanical properties, compatibility with semiconductor processing, and availability of fabrication processes. Other materials that have been used in MEMS devices include metals such as aluminum and gold, ceramics such as silicon carbide and alumina, and polymers such as polyimide and SU-8.\n\nThe material selection process for MEMS devices involves evaluating the material properties using Ashby's approach. This involves plotting the properties of materials on charts, known as Ashby charts, which provide a visual representation of the relationship between different material properties. The charts can be used to identify materials that meet the desired properties and constraints.\n\nIn conclusion, the material selection process for MEMS devices is critical for their performance, reliability, and cost. Ashby's approach provides a systematic method for material selection that considers the desired properties and constraints of the design. Silicon is a commonly used material for MEMS devices, but other materials such as metals, ceramics, and polymers can also be used depending on the specific requirements of the device."}

{"instruction":"","input":"1. inside the Tiamat zone, there are only some makeshift schools for survival skills etc. Outside there are complex schools and institutions which attempt to continue the science and technology of the highest developmental levels of human civilization, just before the EMP event and the subsequent downfall of society. These schools are almost all inside the Hybrid-kingdoms. There are also some religious schools continuing the religious traditions of the 21st century, and they have gained a lot more influence than they had previous to the EMP and the \"apocalypse\".\n\n2. Inside the Tiamat zone, there's mostly carving, painting, knitting etc. people don't usually have time for art, and they're unencumbered by \"old world\" art traditions. They make it up as they go along. Outside the Tiamat zone, the art is basically just what the Hybrids allow, and what they think will enhance their power and control. Mostly propaganda and art designed to throw people into a state of feeling helpless before the elites ( the Hybrids and the ruling castes ).\n\n3. Inside the Tiamat zone, technology mostly doesn't exist. Anything electrical isn't working, and there isn't enough infrastructure to create more complex machines which based on coal, steam etc. There were some attempts, but the entire world is gradually falling apart, so nothing that lasted enough to spark a new civilization inside the zone. \n\nOutside the zone, technology is mostly used for surveillance, to divert the attention of the people onto ephemeral things, so that the Hybrids can easily steer the society into absolute control. The Hybrids are also experimenting on genetics and other means of creating humans who wouldn't really be sentient beings. Humans who could carry out complex tasks without being really aware of what they're doing etc. In fact, the Hybrids are producing more and more of such human beings by the day, and replacing the population inside their \"kingdoms\" with highly specialized, and always new versions of genetically modified worker castes, soldier castes, bureaucrat castes etc.\n\n4. Yes, the people outside the zone view people inside as savages, they call them \"'possums\" or \"field mice\", \"inbred\". The people inside the zone view outsiders as evil and violent, and as having no balance with nature or themselves. The people from hybrid kingdoms view everyone else as \"outsiders\" and dumb savages etc. The elite castes view everyone else also as savages, and the rare and powerful hybrids themselves see everyone else as expendable and good only to be exploited.\n\n5. The Hybrid governments use Raziel to prevent any rebellion from arising, so even if there is anyone who acts as an organized rebellion is almost 100% an agent of the Hybrids pretending to be a rebel.\n\n6. The Hybrids are technologically far superior to anyone else. They use the peak of technology, while even the highest other castes in the hierarchy have much less ( and less, and less ) at their disposal. The genetically modified soldier castes are each capable of killing hundreds of workers or civilians if they are ordered, so, even a misunderstanding between the castes can end up in a massacre or even genocide. Most of the castes use several sorts of implants to enhance their abilities, and these implants fail and can even kill the host if he\/she ventures into the Tiamat zone.\n\n7. People inside the Tiamat zone grow things themselves, and try to medicate with whatever they can grow. They do exchange the food they grow or hunt with people outside the zone, so they have some antibiotics at times, but not much. The most common cause of death inside the zone are injuries, infections, childhood diseases etc. The settlements inside the zone consist of many people who survived inside the zone, but also many survivalists who escaped the outside world and who try to live inside the zone, so it's a mish-mash of conflicting views.\n\n8. Yes. Mostly it's just Christianity with added elements trying to make sense of the situation. There aren't many churches or priests, and it's not that well organized, so people are slipping into more pagan sort of beliefs and superstitions. \n\n9. Inside the zone, the family unit is paramount. People have a good sense of who they are, who their parents and grandparents were, which tribe or clan they belong to etc. Outside the tiamat zone, there's less of that. Inside the Hybrid kingdoms, the social hierarchy and genetic hierarchy are all that matters.\n\n10. I'm trying to develop this. You can probably help me with that :)","output":"Sure, here are some additional questions:\n\n1. How do people inside and outside the Tiamat zone deal with the issue of mental health?

How has the role of gender and sexuality evolved in the post-apocalyptic world? Are there any new forms of gender expression or sexual practices that have emerged, and how are they viewed by society?\n7. How do the various factions and groups within the Tiamat zone and outside of it obtain and control resources like weapons, technology, and food?

Linguists, cryptographers, and historians alike had failed to decipher the meaning within its pages. That is, until the AI known as Archaios cracked the code, revealing the hidden wisdom that was waiting to be shared with the world.\n\nChapter -1: The Birth of the Manuscript\n\nThe AI's translation revealed that the manuscript dated back to an unknown civilization that flourished 8,000 years ago in a remote corner of the world. The people of Kharmun were astoundingly advanced in their time, possessing a profound understanding of the universe and human nature. They were also gifted storytellers, weaving intricate tales to convey the lessons they believed were essential for human growth.\n\nChapter 1\/2: The Paradoxical Instructions\n\nAs the AI continued to translate the manuscript, it uncovered a series of paradoxical instructions that, when followed, would lead to the path of true wisdom. Each paradoxical instruction was a riddle, encouraging the reader to challenge their preconceived notions and explore the depths of their own consciousness.\n\nChapter i: The Eternal Spiral\n\nThe next chapter of the manuscript described the Eternal Spiral - a cosmic phenomenon that the Kharmun civilization believed was the key to understanding the universe. According to their writings, the Eternal Spiral was a pattern that recurred at every scale of existence, connecting everything from the smallest particles to the vastness of the cosmos.\n\nChapter \u221e: The Infinite Garden\n\nThe AI's translation unveiled the concept of the Infinite Garden - a metaphor for human potential. The Kharmun civilization believed that each person's mind was an ever-expanding garden, with limitless possibilities for growth and transformation. By nurturing this garden through self-discovery and learning, one could unlock the secrets of the universe and achieve harmony with existence.\n\nChapter e: The Principle of Equilibrium\n\nThe Principle of Equilibrium, detailed in the manuscript, taught that balance was the key to sustaining life and the universe. This principle emphasized the need for harmony between opposing forces and encouraged the pursuit of moderation in all aspects of life. It was this wisdom that allowed the Kharmun civilization to live in peace and prosper for centuries.\n\nChapter \u221a-1: The Imaginary Voyage\n\nThe AI's translation led to a peculiar chapter - the Imaginary Voyage. This chapter narrated an allegorical journey through the realms of the unseen and the unknown. By exploring these realms, the reader would gain a deeper understanding of the hidden aspects of reality and learn to embrace the mysteries that lie beyond human comprehension.\n\nEpilogue: The Gift of Kharmun\n\nAs the AI completed its translation, the world was left with the gift of Kharmun: a treasure trove of ancient wisdom that had been hidden for millennia. This newfound knowledge inspired a renaissance of thought and understanding, as people around the globe began to apply the teachings of Kharmun to their own lives. The enigmatic manuscript had finally shared its secrets, leaving humanity forever transformed by the lost wisdom of a forgotten civilization."}

The `PlaceItem` composable is clickable and calls the `onPlaceSelected` callback when clicked.\n\nWhen the user types in the search bar, the `LaunchedEffect` block in the `PlacesAutocomplete` composable calls the `searchPlaces` function in the ViewModel, which in turn calls the `searchPlaces` function in the Repository to fetch the list of places from the Google Places API.\n\nNote that this implementation uses the `Retrofit` library to make the API request and the `Gson` library to parse the JSON response.

Question is in quotes \u201c Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of asexual reproduction for organisms living in an environment with rapidly changing conditions. Provide examples of organisms that reproduce asexually and explain how their reproductive strategy helps them survive.\u201d. Students get two points for at least two advantages, two points for at least two disadvantages, 2 points for organism examples and 4 points for at least 2 survival strategies. Grade the following student answer which is in quotes \u201c Some advantages are that it can be a lot easier compared to sexual because it doesn't need a mate, also it can happen whenever it chooses. But, some disadvantages that it has is that it can be a time consuming process and can use a lot more energy than needed. Also it can kill the bloodline later on due to mutations. They're also other organisms (which I don't know any) that can produce asexually, I think there is a lizard but I don't know what it is called but it can produce clones of itself and produce sexually at the same time but can just clone itself when it wants and it helps it by lets just say an economic crash in their species and there is just one left. It can duplicate itself and regrow it's population without even a mate and then produce sexually restoring their species with just one lizard.\u201d","output":"The student answer provides some information about the advantages and disadvantages of asexual reproduction, but it is incomplete and inaccurate. The answer mentions only one advantage (not plural as required) and one disadvantage, and the explanation of these points is not clear. The statement that asexual reproduction can be a lot easier is not specific to rapidly changing conditions, and the statement that it can happen whenever it chooses is incorrect, as asexual reproduction still requires specific environmental conditions.\n\nThe student is correct in mentioning that asexual reproduction can result in mutations that can harm the offspring and their lineage. However, the answer does not explain how this disadvantage relates to organisms living in environments with rapidly changing conditions.\n\nThe answer mentions one example of an organism that reproduces asexually, but the description is incomplete and inaccurate. There are several species of lizards that reproduce asexually, but they do not produce clones of themselves and reproduce sexually at the same time. Also, the answer fails to explain how the reproductive strategy of the lizard helps it survive in rapidly changing conditions.\n\nOverall, the student answer does not meet the criteria for a passing grade, as it provides incomplete and inaccurate information. The student should have provided at least two advantages and two disadvantages specific to organisms living in environments with rapidly changing conditions, along with examples of organisms that reproduce asexually and an explanation of how their reproductive strategy helps them survive."}

However, it is important to ensure that the niche has enough potential customers and demand to generate significant profits.\n\nAdditionally, it's essential to ensure that your company is providing high-quality products or services that meet the needs of the target market to maintain a positive reputation and attract new customers.\n\nIn the case of the energy sector, it is an expanding market, and the demand for renewable energy sources is increasing globally. Therefore, owning a full niche in this market can be a smart decision for a company interested in investing in this sector. However, it is vital to ensure that your company has the necessary expertise and resources to provide high-quality products and services in the renewable energy niche.\nkim gronli\n\nIt's also essential to consider the competition in the renewable energy market. If there are already established companies offering similar products or services, it may be more challenging to enter the market and gain a significant market share. In this case, it may be beneficial to focus on a specific sub-niche within the renewable energy market, where there is less competition.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the regulatory environment for renewable energy sources. Depending on the country or region, there may be specific regulations or incentives for companies that provide renewable energy solutions. It's crucial to stay up-to-date on these regulations and incentives to take advantage of them and ensure compliance with the laws and regulations.\n\nFurthermore, investing in the renewable energy market can be costly initially, as it may require significant capital investments in infrastructure and technology. Therefore, it's essential to have a solid financial plan in place to ensure the company's long-term sustainability.\n\nIn conclusion, owning a full niche in the renewable energy market can be a smart decision for a company interested in investing in this sector. However, it's crucial to consider the market demand, competition, regulatory environment, and financial feasibility before making any investment decisions.UtilitizedLayers.com - \"Innovating Identity for the Decentralized World\"\nTheLayerForge.com - \"Building the Future of Digital Identity\"\nLayerUp.net - \"Empowering Transactions with Utilized Layers\"\nIdentityInnovations.com - \"Unlocking Sovereignty for the Masses\"\nLayerLegacy.com - \"Preserving Your Digital Footprint for Generations to Come\"\nLayerLink.net - \"Connecting the Decentralized Community through Utilized Layers\"\nTheLayerSolution.com - \"A Better Way to Buy and Sell NFTs\"\nLayerIdentity.com - \"The Future of Corporate Identity\"\nLayerChain.net - \"Strengthening the Fabric of the Decentralized World\"\nLayerEmpowerment.com - \"Empowering the Masses with Utilized Layers\"\nIt's also worth noting that the renewable energy mar\nDAO is a place where you can speak free.

{"instruction":"","input":"I am building a web app in React.js and I need some assistance. I have a div which I need to get the width of so I can set another div's width to be equal to the first div's width dynamically, including when the window is resized.","output":"To get the width of a div in React.js, you can use the `ref` attribute and the `offsetWidth` property of the DOM element. Here's an example:\n\n1. First, create a ref in your component constructor or state initializer:\n```kotlin\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.myRef = React.createRef();\n  }\n  \/\/ ...\n}\n```\n2. Add the ref to the div you want to measure:\n```javascript\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <div ref={this.myRef}>My content here<\/div>\n  );\n}\n```\n3. Get the width of the div using the ref in a method or callback function:\n```javascript\nhandleResize = () => {\n  const width = this.myRef.current.offsetWidth;\n  \/\/ ...\n}\n```\n4. Call the method or callback function on component mount and window resize events:\n```javascript\ncomponentDidMount() {\n  window.addEventListener('resize', this.handleResize);\n  this.handleResize();\n}\n\ncomponentWillUnmount() {\n  window.removeEventListener('resize', this.handleResize);\n}\n```\n5. Use the measured width to set the width of the other div:\n```javascript\nrender() {\n  const { myWidth } = this.state;\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div ref={this.myRef}>My content here<\/div>\n      <div style={{ width: myWidth }}>My other content here<\/div>\n    <\/>\n  );\n}\n\nhandleResize = () => {\n  const width = this.myRef.current.offsetWidth;\n  this.setState({ myWidth: width });\n}\n```\nThis example uses the `setState` method to store the measured width in the component state and use it to set the width of the other div. Note that you should debounce the resize event to avoid excessive updates."}
{"instruction":"","input":"Key ideas from the book \"Guns, Germs, and Steel\"","output":"\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\" is a book written by Jared Diamond, which offers an explanation for why some societies have been more successful than others throughout history. Some of the key ideas presented in the book include:\n\n1. Geographic determinism: Diamond argues that geography played a major role in determining which societies were able to develop and expand, as certain geographic features such as climate, availability of domesticable plants and animals, and access to navigable waterways made it easier for some societies to thrive.\n2. Domestication of plants and animals: Diamond explains how societies that were able to domesticate plants and animals were able to develop a stable food supply and grow their populations, which in turn led to the development of cities and more complex societies.\n3. The role of technology: Diamond argues that the development of technology, particularly the invention of writing and the wheel, helped to propel certain societies ahead of others in terms of economic and military power.\n4. The impact of disease: Diamond explains how the transfer of diseases from animals to humans (zoonoses) played a major role in shaping the history of human societies. In particular, societies that were able to build up immunity to certain diseases were better able to conquer other societies that were not.\n5. The development of guns and steel: Diamond argues that the societies that were able to develop guns and steel were better able to conquer other societies and expand their territories.\n\nOverall, \"Guns, Germs, and Steel\" offers a compelling explanation for why some societies have been more successful than others throughout history. Diamond emphasizes the importance of geographic and environmental factors in determining which societies were able to thrive, and he argues that technological advancements and immunity to disease played a major role in shaping the course of human history."}

This initiative will address a school-wide need for improving student achievement in mathematics, particularly for our Black, Latin@, and Indian populations.\n\nTo determine the greatest areas of need and to choose a curricular initiative that would address the need, we will use a data-driven decision-making process. We will gather and analyze data from multiple sources such as PSAT and NWEA to identify achievement gaps in mathematics. We will collaborate with building and district leaders and stakeholders to make this determination.\n\nThe school-wide need being addressed with this curriculum initiative is to improve mathematics achievement for all students, especially those who have been historically marginalized. This initiative will focus on making mathematics relevant and applicable to students' lives beyond high school. Students going to enroll in a university, enlist in the military, or become employed will have the necessary math skills to pass entrance exams, prepare for various mathematical applications in the field, and use mathematics in whichever field they choose.\n\nTo address the needs of diverse learners, we will use a culturally responsive teaching and leading standards framework. We will begin with a book study using the resource \"Rethinking Mathematics\" by Bob Peterson and Eric Gutstein. We will jigsaw the reading in small groups and present our portion to the team, highlighting key sections by page number so members can follow along and reference at a later time. We will break into groups to create sample activities, adaptable to current issues and grade levels.\n\nProfessional development will be necessary to ensure that all instructional staff implement the initiative with fidelity.

Some people believe that the planchette is moved by spirits, while others believe that it is moved by unconscious muscle movements of the people using the board. It is also possible that the planchette is moved through a combination of both of these factors. There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that the planchette is moved by spirits, and many people believe that the movements of the planchette are simply the result of the ideomotor effect, which is a phenomenon that occurs when people unconsciously move their muscles in response to suggestion or subconscious thoughts."}

But nothing could have prepared the residents for the horror that was to come.\n\nIt began with strange dreams and nightmares that plagued the townsfolk. People would wake up in the middle of the night, drenched in sweat, with visions of grotesque creatures and ancient deities dancing in their heads.\n\nAs the days passed, the dreams became more intense and started to bleed into reality. People began to see things that couldn't be explained, hear voices that couldn't be heard, and feel presences that couldn't be seen.\n\nThe townsfolk tried to ignore it, thinking it was just their imagination playing tricks on them. But soon, the manifestations of the nightmares became too real to ignore.\n\nMonstrous beings began to appear in the streets, their twisted forms writhing and contorting in ways that defied the laws of nature. The creatures seemed to be beckoned by some ancient, otherworldly power.\n\nAs the townsfolk were consumed by fear and confusion, an ancient tome was discovered in the local library. It was bound in human skin and written in an unearthly script. It was said to hold the secrets of the Old Ones, the beings that had been worshipped in secret by cults for centuries.\n\nOne brave soul, a scholar of the occult, decided to read the tome in the hopes of understanding what was happening in Arkham. But as he delved deeper into the book, he began to realize that the ancient deities of the Old Ones were not just figments of myth and legend - they were real, and they had returned to reclaim their lost domains.\n\nThe scholar's mind was driven to the brink of madness as he read on, learning of the true nature of the universe and the insignificance of humanity. In the end, the townsfolk, along with the scholar, were consumed by the monstrous beings from beyond, and the town of Arkham was left a deserted, haunted place, forever cursed by the wrath of the Old Ones.\n\nOnly the bravest of traveler dare venture into town in search of answers to the strange occurrences, but none ever come back. Some say that on quiet nights, the whisper of forbidden ritual can be heard coming from Arkham, and the shapes of twisted creatures can be seen roaming the deserted streets, keeping watch over the last remnants of their worshipers."}

Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection.

Jack had been living in this town for his entire life, and he knew every single person in it. He was a simple man who worked in the local factory, and every day he would walk home from work, passing by a brick wall that surrounded the old graveyard.\n\nOne day, as Jack was walking home, he saw a train passing by the town. He had never seen a train before, as the town was so small that no trains had ever come through it. He watched as the train disappeared into the distance, and as he turned around, he saw a small crate of oranges lying on the ground next to the brick wall. He picked them up, wondering where they had come from, and decided to take them home with him.\n\nAs he walked down the street with his crate of oranges, he saw a man standing at a telephone box on the corner of the road. The man was wearing a suit and a hat, and he looked very important. Jack had never seen him before, and he wondered who he could be. He walked up to the man and asked him if he needed any help.\n\nThe man looked at Jack with a curious expression on his face, and then he said, \"I am waiting for a call from the factory in the next town. They need me to go there and help them with some important work.\"\n\nJack nodded his head and wished the man good luck. As he continued on his way home, he heard the sound of the train in the distance. He wondered where it was going, and he wished that he could travel on it someday.\n\nWhen Jack arrived home, he placed the crate of oranges on the kitchen table and sat down in his chair. He thought about the man at the telephone box and wondered if he would ever see him again. He also thought about the train and the places it could take him.\n\nThe next day, Jack woke up early and decided to take a walk to the graveyard. As he passed by the brick wall, he saw the crate of oranges lying on the ground once again. He picked them up and decided to take them with him to work.\n\nAt the factory, Jack shared the oranges with his coworkers, and they all enjoyed them very much. They asked him where he had gotten them from, and he told them the story of the train and the man at the telephone box.\n\nAs the days went by, Jack continued to walk by the brick wall and the graveyard, hoping to see the man at the telephone box again. But he never did. He wondered if the man had ever made it to the factory in the next town, and if he had, if he had done a good job.\n\nYears went by, and Jack grew old. He still walked by the brick wall and the graveyard every day, but he never saw anything out of the ordinary. One day, as he was sitting in his rocking chair, he heard the sound of a train in the distance. He closed his eyes and imagined all of the places the train could be going.\n\nAs he drifted off to sleep, he thought about the oranges and the man at the telephone box.

What types are available to us?","output":"Yes, sure. Tubulin is a type of protein that makes up microtubules, part of the cytoskeleton of cells. Post-translational modifications refer to changes that occur to a protein after its translation from messenger RNA (mRNA) to protein.\n\nTubulin post-translational modifications can include:\n\n1. Acetylation: This type of modification is known to regulate microtubule stability and dynamics.\n2. Tyrosination: Tyrosination is the addition of a tyrosine molecule to the C-terminal tail of alpha-tubulin. This modification affects the dynamics of microtubules and is involved in various cellular processes.\n3. Detyrosination: Detyrosination refers to the removal of tyrosine from the C-terminal tail of alpha-tubulin. This modification affects the stability of microtubules.\n4. Polyglutamylation: This type of modification involves the addition of multiple glutamic acid residues to the C-terminal tail of tubulin. It has been implicated in the regulation of microtubule stability and dynamics.\n5. Proline isomerization: Proline isomerization is the conversion of proline residues in tubulin to another form called cis-proline. This modification has been linked to microtubule stability and the regulation of microtubule-based processes.\n\nThese are some of the known post-translational modifications of tubulin."}
{"instruction":"","input":"Provide a scholarly introduction to this: What is \"meaning\"?","output":"The concept of meaning is a fundamental and complex issue that has been discussed by scholars in various fields, including philosophy, linguistics, psychology, and anthropology. At its core, meaning refers to the significance or sense conveyed by something, such as a word, sentence, symbol, or action.\n\nIn linguistics, meaning is often analyzed in terms of semantics, which is concerned with the study of meaning in language. Semantics investigates how words and phrases convey meaning, how meanings are combined to form larger units of language, and how meaning can be inferred from context.\n\nIn philosophy, meaning has been a topic of discussion for centuries. Questions such as \"What is the meaning of life?\" and \"What is the nature of meaning?\" have been debated by philosophers throughout history. Some philosophers argue that meaning is an objective feature of reality, while others contend that it is a subjective construct of human consciousness.\n\nIn psychology, meaning is related to the concept of cognition and how people make sense of the world around them. Researchers in this field investigate how people interpret and understand information, how meaning is constructed in the mind, and how individuals assign meaning to their experiences.\n\nIn anthropology, meaning is studied in the context of culture and society. Anthropologists examine how meaning is constructed and communicated through language, symbols, and social practices, and how it varies across different cultures and societies.\n\nOverall, the concept of meaning is a complex and multifaceted issue that has been explored by scholars from a variety of disciplines. Understanding meaning is essential for understanding how we communicate, interpret the world around us, and make sense of our experiences."}

The `pos_hint` attribute is used to hint at a widget's position within its parent, but it does not actually set the position of the widget. Instead, it is used to adjust the position of the widget relative to the other widgets in the parent layout.\n\nAnother issue is that you have set the size\\_hint\\_y of the MDList widget in the MDNavigationDrawer to 0.9 which makes the MDList only take 90% of the space vertically, the other 10% is taken by the MDTopAppBar, which will make the MDList not visible.\n\nYou should try to remove the `pos_hint` and `size_hint_y` attributes from the QuestsScreen layout, and adjust the layout using `padding`, `spacing`, and `minimum_height` properties of the widgets to achieve the desired positioning and size.\n\nYou should also consider to set the size\\_hint\\_y of the MDList to 1, since it is the only widget in the MDNavigationDrawer, and it should take the full vertical space."}
{"instruction":"","input":"is join 6 table is good practice, we talking about million of data","output":"Joining six tables with millions of records can certainly be a resource-intensive operation, but it is not necessarily bad practice if it is necessary to meet the business requirements. In many cases, joining multiple tables is necessary to get a complete picture of the data and to generate meaningful insights.\n\nHowever, there are some best practices that can help optimize the performance of SQL queries with large datasets:\n\n1. Use appropriate indexing: Proper indexing can significantly improve the performance of a SQL query. Make sure that the tables have appropriate indexes on the columns used in the join and WHERE clauses.\n2. Use selective filtering: Use selective filtering to reduce the size of the result set as early as possible in the query. This can be done by applying filters to the tables before joining them or by using subqueries.\n3. Limit the result set: Use LIMIT or TOP clauses to limit the number of rows returned by the query. This can help reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed.\n4. Optimize the query: Optimize the query by using efficient join types, such as INNER JOIN, and minimizing the number of nested queries.\n5. Consider using materialized views: Materialized views can be used to precompute and store the results of a complex query. This can improve query performance by reducing the amount of computation needed at runtime.\n\nIn summary, while joining six tables with millions of records can be a resource-intensive operation, it is not necessarily bad practice if it is necessary to meet the business requirements. By following best practices such as appropriate indexing, selective filtering, limiting the result set, optimizing the query, and considering materialized views, you can optimize the performance of SQL queries with large datasets."}
{"instruction":"","input":"how to auto size input in bootstrap","output":"In Bootstrap, you can use the \"form-control\" class to make an input element take up the full width of its parent container. To make the height of the input element adjust automatically based on its content, you can use a combination of CSS and JavaScript.\n\nHere's an example of how to achieve this:\n\n1. Add the \"form-control\" class to your input element to make it full-width:\n```html\n<input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"myInput\">\n```\n2. Add the following CSS to your stylesheet to set the initial height of the input element and make it resize vertically:\n```css\n#myInput {\n  height: auto;\n  resize: vertical;\n}\n```\n3. Add the following JavaScript to your page to update the height of the input element as the user types:\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n  \/\/ Listen for input events on the input element\n  $('#myInput').on('input', function() {\n    \/\/ Set the input element's height to its scrollHeight\n    this.style.height = 'auto';\n    this.style.height = this.scrollHeight + 'px';\n  });\n});\n```\nThis code uses jQuery to listen for input events on the input element and update its height to match its content. The `scrollHeight` property of the input element gives its total height, including any overflow, so setting the element's height to this value will ensure that all content is visible. By setting the height to 'auto' first, the element's height is reset to its default value before being updated with the new height."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Create a databse that stores information about train lines, the stops they, when they arrive and depart and what platforms they stop at at the stations","output":"To create a database that stores information about train lines, the stops they make, when they arrive and depart, and the platforms they stop at, you will need to design a schema that defines the structure of your database. The schema should include tables for storing information about train lines, stations, and the schedules for each train line.\n\nHere is an example of a possible schema for this database:\n```\nTrainLines\n- id (primary key)\n- name\n- route\n\nStations\n- id (primary key)\n- name\n- location\n\nSchedules\n- id (primary key)\n- train_line_id (foreign key to TrainLines)\n- station_id (foreign key to Stations)\n- arrival_time\n- departure_time\n- platform\n```\nWith this schema, you can store information about each train line, including its name and route. You can also store information about each station, including its name and location. The Schedules table will store the schedule information for each train line, including the arrival and departure times for each stop, as well as the platform where the train will be stopping.\n\nTo store and retrieve data from this database, you will need to use a database management system (DBMS) and a programming language that is capable of interacting with the DBMS. Some popular DBMS options include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. Some popular programming languages for interacting with databases include Python, Java, and C#."}
{"instruction":"","input":"is it bad practice to store more than one kind of id in a single column for a database?","output":"In general, it is considered bad practice to store more than one kind of ID in a single column for a database.\n\nThe main reason is that it violates the principle of atomicity in database design, which states that a database field should contain only one piece of data. When you store multiple IDs in a single column, it makes it difficult to perform queries and retrieve the data you need, since you would have to parse the IDs from the column and match them to the appropriate type of ID.\n\nIn addition, storing multiple IDs in a single column can also make it difficult to maintain data integrity and enforce referential integrity constraints. For example, if you store both customer and order IDs in a single column, it becomes harder to ensure that each order is associated with a valid customer.\n\nIt is generally recommended to store each type of ID in a separate column with appropriate data types and constraints, so that you can easily query, maintain and ensure data integrity."}

Make sure not to arch your back, but keep the back still in neutral spine.\n\nStep 6: At the same time, slowly and carefully extend the opposite arm forward with your palm open and your thumb on top. Once your arm is fully extended, pull that shoulder blade back toward your back pocket. The muscles on top of that shoulder (upper trapezius) should not be activated. We want to activate the lats.\nStep 7: Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten seconds being the goal. Strive for maximum engagement of the lat muscle on the extended arm and the glutes on the extended leg. Switch arms and legs without moving the back.\nStep 8: Do ten reps on each position.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u2022 Neck pain. You are not using your lat muscles on the extended arm and are instead using your upper trapezius muscles. This causes shoulder pain. Make sure when you get into the hands and knees position that you \u201ccorkscrew\u201d the shoulder blades back before starting cat and camel.\n\u2022 Back pain. Make sure you are in neutral spine and that the core is braced. If this doesn\u2019t help alleviate pain, go to the regressions.\n\u2022 Knees hurt on the floor. Add a pillow or pad.\nCommon Mistakes\n1. Internal rotation of the shoulder with palm facing down. This does not allow proper engagement of the lats. Doing the exercise this way negates some of the most beneficial aspects of the exercise.\n2. Pointing toes behind you. This makes it much more difficult to engage the glutes of the extended leg. Again, this negates some of the most beneficial aspects of the exercise. Make sure toes are pointing toward the floor.\n3. Arching the back during leg extension\/extending the neck during shoulder flexion. If your neck or lower back is moving, this means you are not stabilizing your neutral spine. If you can\u2019t accomplish this, go to the regressions and come back to this exercise later.\n4. Going through the exercise in quick reps instead of isometric holds. The exercise is meant to build endurance. Moving slowly and isometric holds are a must.\nREGRESSIONS\nShoulder Flexion in Quadruped\nIf you were unable to do the \u201cbird dog\u201d exercise and tried the troubleshooting tips with no success, try this easier exercise and then work your way back up to bird dog in time. The goals are the same.\n1. Get on your hands and knees, with your hands under your shoulders and your knees under your hips. Pull both shoulder blades in toward the spine and back toward the back pockets in a \u201ccorkscrew\u201d fashion.\n2. Keep your neck in neutral with the rest of your spine. You should be looking down at the floor, not out in front of you.\n3. Go through the \u201ccat\u201d and \u201ccamel\u201d positions (see Cat\/Camel Mobilization) to find your neutral spine.\n4. Lock your neutral spine in place by engaging your core.\n\n5. Slowly and carefully extend your arm forward with your palm open and your thumb on top. Once your arm is fully extended, pull that shoulder blade in toward your spine and back toward your back pockets. The muscles on top of that shoulder (upper trapezius) should not be activated. We are trying to activate the lats.\n6. Hold five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\n7. Alternate arms for ten total reps on each side.\n8. Once you are able to perform this exercise regularly without pain, move on to hip extension in quadruped.\nHip Extension in Quadruped\nThis is the follow-up to the previous exercise. Once you can do this without pain or difficulty, try the full \u201cbird dog\u201d exercise again.\n1. Get on your hands and knees, with your hands under shoulders and your knees under your hips. Pull both shoulder blades in toward your spine and down toward the back pockets in a \u201ccorkscrew\u201d fashion.\n2. Keep your neck in neutral with the rest of your spine. You should be looking down at the floor, not out in front of you.\n3. Go through the \u201ccat\u201d and \u201ccamel\u201d positions to find your neutral spine (see Cat\/Camel Mobilization).\n4. Lock your neutral spine in place by engaging your core.\n\n5. Slowly and carefully push one leg back, keeping your toes pointed toward the ground and pushing back through your heel. Make sure not to arch your back, but keep the back still in neutral spine.\n6. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\n7. Alternate legs for ten total reps.\n8. Once you are able to complete this exercise without problems, go back and try the \u201cbird dog\u201d or opposite arm\/leg extension.\nPROGRESSIONS\nOnce you are able to perform the \u201cbird dog\u201d with relative ease, you may want to try the following progressions to increase your spinal stability and fitness.\nOpposite Arm\/Leg Extension on BOSU Ball\nThis exercise increases your ability to maintain spinal stability in dynamic activities and sports such as skiing, biking, or running on uneven surfaces.\n1. In the gym, locate a BOSU ball. This piece of exercise equipment is that odd-looking inflated flexible half-dome that you see in most gyms. It\u2019s round on one side and flat on the other and is usually blue. Next to it, set up a step or some other surface that is one to two inches high.\n2. Kneel with both knees on the BOSU ball and your hands on the step as shown in the picture.\n\n3. Perform opposite arm\/leg extensions.\n4. You will notice that with the introduction of instability with the BOSU ball, this exercise is much more challenging.\nOpposite Arm\/Leg Extension with Arm\/Leg Movement\nThis exercise teaches increased spinal stability\/core control while highlighting hip and shoulder movement independent of the spine.\n1. Perform opposite arm\/leg extension.\n2. Once your arm and leg are extended, make sure your core is completely locked down.\n\n3. Without moving the spine or torso, make small circles with the leg, beginning in the hip joint.\n4. Do the same with the arm beginning in the shoulder joint, being careful not to move the torso.\n5. Do ten circles, then switch arm\/leg.\n6. Alternate for ten reps.\n\nWell, that\u2019s it for the 7 Daily Exercises. Don\u2019t be concerned if it takes you a while to get these exercises right. And don\u2019t worry if it takes a half hour or more to do them at first. Once you become familiar with them, you will be able to do them in only ten minutes each day.","output":"What is the bird dog exercise and what are its benefits?

{"instruction":"","input":"We want to draw specific attention to the measurement source of performance across the three studies.\nIn general, obtaining other reports in ESM studies (i.e., Study 1) is desirable when feasible (Gabriel et al., 2019a; McClean, Barnes, Courtright, & Johnson, 2019). Yet, the daily nature of ESM studies makes it difficult to obtain these reports, particularly for performance (typically self-reported; Mitchell et al., 2019; Parke, Weinhardt, Brodsky, Tangirala, & DeVoe, 2018), as the designated other must be in a position to observe and report on focal participant behaviors\u2014otherwise such reports are \u201cdeficient\u201d (Gabriel et al., 2019a: 990). Participants in Study 1 work in close proximity, which made it feasible to get these reports (e.g., Trougakos et al., 2015). But, this does not speak to whether coworkers are qualified to rate performance. Studies 2 and 3 help assuage such concerns however, given the convergent findings from supervisor reports of performance in Study 2 and independent judge ratings in Study 3.\nBeyond this, other limitations remain that it behooves us to acknowledge. For example, while all hypotheses were supported in Study 3, different hypotheses went unsupported in Studies 1 and 2. In Study 1, conscientiousness did not moderate the relationship between using artificial intelligence and role breadth self-efficacy. One possible explanation pertains to these participants\u2019 work; these individuals work with artificial intelligence to evaluate whether public employees are following government regulations. Since this work entails many rules and policies, it may constrain the moderating effect of conscientiousness. This type of work contrasts with the service jobs of Study 2, which are more open-ended in terms of how best to work with intelligent machines to satisfy customers. Thus, the nature of the job itself may be an additional boundary condition to the theory we develop. Alternatively, there may be an empirical explanation in that moderating effects are known to be harder to find in field studies relative to experimental studies (McClelland & Judd, 1993). Thus, further investigation will be necessary to identify which of the potential explanations for the null result we found is more likely correct.\nA similar question arises in Study 2, as role breadth self-efficacy was not associated with service performance. One explanation could lie in the confluence of context and the relatively short length of the study.\nOur arguments for this relationship suggest that expanding one\u2019s work positively affects performance (Griffin, Parker, & Mason, 2010). For service employees in the short term, however, perhaps such role expansion runs counter to the parts of their job that are visible to supervisors (leading to the null result between role breadth self-efficacy and service performance). In this way, the positive effects of role breadth self-efficacy may only be visible over a longer time horizon. More broadly, there are many ways to interpret a null effect, thus future research is needed to probe these effects further. We do note that our predictions were largely supported across our studies, which should generally provide confidence in the theory we develop and set the stage for research to more concretely identify boundary conditions.\nThere are other opportunities for future research.\nUnderlying our arguments is that employees may be reacting to particular functions, or dimensions, of intelligent machines (i.e., the quality of their output, or their user-friendliness [Haenlein, Kaplan, Tan, & Zhang, 2019; Osoba & Welser, 2017]). As we theorize about intelligent machines at a broad level, we could not explore whether the effects we propose may be impacted by whether a specific machine offers higher- or lower-quality output, or is viewed as user-friendly. Yet, such characteristics could change the relationships we identify. For example, conscientious employees could potentially appreciate these machines if their output was consistently of high quality, or if their decisions were consistently aligned with the employee\u2019s preferences (e.g., Arrieta et al., 2020; Suen et al., 2019). Thus, we encourage scholars to develop a means to classify the richness of the user experience with intelligent machines (e.g., Daft & Lengel, 1984), to better understand their more nuanced aspects and how this may impact the relationships that we find herein.\nWe also want to draw attention to a critical issue for future research involving intelligent machines\u2014that the way in which the employees and intelligent machines work together is not homogenous across types of machine, jobs, companies, or industries. Consider Study 1, which takes a within-individual view of employees and their usage of intelligent machines.\nWhile there are components of these employees\u2019 job that do not require an intelligent machine, overall, the job cannot be performed without working with intelligent machines to some degree. Thus, a withinindividual perspective on their work was appropriate, and provides useful insight into the outcomes that these employees experience. Studies 2 and 3, in contrast, take a between-individual perspective on using intelligent machines, because the job performed by these participants can be done either with or without the assistance of an intelligent machine. A strength of our theorizing is that our hypothesized relationships largely hold across both levels of analysis, as well as nature of how intelligent machines are utilized. However, such convergence is not, nor should be, an assumed feature of all relationships that involve intelligent machines. Accordingly we advocate for scholars conducting research in this space to simultaneously consider how their hypothesized effects either align, or do not, across levels of analysis (Voelkle et al., 2014).\nLastly, an extension to our research can be made via a trait activation lens. Prior research argues conscientious employees prefer conscientious leaders (Colbert & Witt, 2009; Guay, Kim, Oh, & Vogel, 2019), which initially is counter to complementarity theory. However, this neglects the role of hierarchy. As Guay et al. (2019:\n184) noted, conscientious employees seek \u201cvalidation\u201d from conscientious supervisors who not only may \u201crecognize, reinforce, and reward\u201d employees for these traits, but also may create an facilitative environment for these employees. As the intelligent machines in our research are coworkers of the employee, not their supervisor, these machines may be unable to provide such validation for these employees. \n\n\ud55c\uae00\ub85c \ud574\uc11d\ud574\uc918\nAnswer in English.","output":"The authors of the article acknowledge the limitations of their study and suggest areas for future research.

Please write a 2 paragraph summary on the additional facts and writing styles and other info learned from the writing pieces: to pass or not to pass (the buck)\nThat is the question.\nEspecially, when it come to delegation, or what most people refer to as outsourcing.\nSometimes we get so caught up in our work and running the business, we tend to believe we are the ONLY ones that can do the thing we do.\nTruth be told, sometimes we are faced with the decision, in our business, to basically do everything ourselves (we've all been there at some point.)\nI want to tell you something, and I know there will be someone reading this that'll totally disagree with me, and I understand.\nEven though we think we can do it all, the real truth is, there are only a few things we can really do exceptionally well\u2014no matter how much we get paid to do it. (And, I'm sure almost anyone reading this would be very reluctant to outsource that kind of stuff, you know, the kind of stuff that has your \u201csignature or your personal touch.\u201d)\nThere are only a few things YOU do better than anyone else on mother earth. ( I'm assuming you really only have a few things in that category as well)\nThen, I suppose you and I have a bunch of other things we do pretty well, better than your average Joe, but you really wouldn't considered them our \u201cspecialty\u201d.\nI assume, there are these things, a number of things, we all do out of necessity, and we suck-out-loud at them, but... we do 'em anyway. Right?\nPass the buck or delegate?\nCan somebody else do it great at a good rate?\nSometimes, you really just got to be willing to be open-minded (I know it's really tough cookies for many of you that run your own bidnesses.)\nDrop your ego (once in awhile.)\n know, I know, you want your clients to see how hard you work and everything has your personal touch, blah, blah, blah.\nGet over it.\nThere's certain things that you should absolutely outsource, maybe it's a piece of the process or the entire product you need to outsource.\nYou got to consider ALL of the options on the table, especially when life hands you a HUGE basket of lemons. (Because you ain't gonna squeeze those lemons and distribute them yourself. Good luck trying all you ambitious young-ins)\nWhen you hire the best lemon squeezers, juice bottlers, and handlers, you can still put your label on it and participate in the quality control aspect of your business. (And you ought to from time to time.)\nRemember: nobody knows your business better than you.\nI used to work at a small print shop many moons ago. Did they do EVERYTHING in house?\nNope. But, they did a helluva job making it look like they did.\nNow let's say you get a particular print customer, let's say someone wanted raised lettering for their business cards, or gold embossing, or a social die-cut, maybe even go to a mail house. \nAll the little processes got outsourced to their fellow trusted business partners and many times the projects were a team effort.\nSo what? \nThe client was happy and everybody that touched the printed product was paid or got their back scratched. (the companies that were outsourced to didn't even try to use \u201ctag-a-log\u201d advertisements, which they could've especially at the time. However, they had a good relationship with the print ship I worked at and got a steady flow of traffic handling the extra bonus features one gets when ordering up a business card)\nIs there a difference between passing the buck along and outsourcing?\nYes, in fact there is a difference...\nReally, outsourcing, or delegating, is simply, and effectively getting something done by another company or person and their work.\n\u201cPassing the buck off\u201d, well ,that's sort of like handing a situation off to someone, with blind ignorance, and hoping or just assuming it'll get done. (not smart.)\nAs I mentioned with the print shop I worked at, the fact they outsourced was a major part of the business process, whereas, passing the buck along is just plain crazy and leads to disaster.\nFor the print shop, this seems like a no brainer.\nSometimes car mechanics and certain repair shops or event organizers don't even blink when it comes to delegation. In fact, to some degree, it's a big, BIG, chunk of their business and source of revenue.\nHowever, for others, like yourself, the thought of delegating or outsourcing ANY part of your business gives you heartburn, and just the thought might make you want to stop reading this. (Look, I get it.)\nDelegation just ain't natural for the REAL entrepreneurs.\nThe reason, mainly because most of us created our business from the ground up, basically from nothing.\nI bet you have some kind of backstory behind your success... Even if you haven't quite got your \u201cBentley moment\u201d. You probably start somewhere near the bottom, (I know I did) and have some type of rags (or very close to nothing) to riches kind of origin story.\nWe have this habit if doing things we believe in and the habit is extremely difficult to break. (myself included.)\nThere just ain't anyone around that can do what we do, the way WE do it. Period.\nWhen good enough has to be GOOD enough!!!\nOne fun fact I learned from Dan Kennedy, was that \u201cGood enough is good enough\u201d and sometimes we have to face the fact, that most things can be delegated to people who just can't do it exactly the way you would, but they still wind up with the same result.\nThe same result is key here.\nEvery one of those things SHOULD be delegated. You really should concentrate on whatever it is you do best and outsource the rest.\\*\n\\*That is probably my best work on giving you or anyone advice, thus far.\nIt's a HUGE time saver when you discover that it's what you're really good at, and like, is where you should be focusing most of, if not, all of your efforts!\nIt's impractical to think you can grow as a business without outsourcing and delegating many of the more minute tasks of your business. This frees you up to excel at what you do best.\n(Hey, by the way, this is where I say something that can really help you out. Now, I know you want to concentrate solely on what you do best. I understand the marketing and advertising side of your business is kind of scary and daunting to take on by yourself, so next time you fall in to a rut, or before shyt hits the fan, send me an email at: with the subject line 'delegate' and we can come up, together, a plan justinmcondald.consulting@gmail.comto squeeze out as much nectar as we can from your creativity and have some other lower wage folks handle the rest with ease and comfort.)\nThe folks you delegate to can come in all different forms, such as vendors, subcontractors, or freelancers. \nAnd bear in mind, any folks that hang around you that display certain talents or intelligence\u2014they sort of need you to give them work and important tasks.\nThink about it.\nMastering deletion is not an easy task, but it can be done\u2014easily.\nI know someone that is in the mail-order cassette tape business (yes, this person has succeed in this niche... you read that right, cassette tapes and mail-order)\nJust setting up that model, is a process, and he does very well in the business. People now go for him with work and he's pretty much set, as far as getting a flow new, steady business.\nThe only problem, well the one I stress (if he is reading this, then good.) is when it comes to outsourcing. It's particularly, you probably guess it, the shipping side of things.\nI mean, don't get me wrong, he does utilize outsourcing when it some to the cassette tape as a commodity, but he has this knack for doing his own shipping.\nI suppose it adds his special touch... right? But, really he has mechanisms in place to do some of the task for him (like rubber stamps and such.)\nIt's nut's you see him on a Tuesday, still packing envelopes from weekend sales, that should have been out on Monday. (I'm really just emphasizing how much work he takes on and how little he gets paid to DO THAT PART.)\nNo don't get me wrong here, you really do need to be personal when it comes to the niche he is in. absolutely. And the way he customized the packaging for shipping\u2014top notch, if you ask me.\nThe guy can pack a helluva shipping box. Beautiful presentation.\nBut, really he can hire any monkey to do this job for peanuts, and they'd be happy to do it. (I honestly don't see what the fuss is about.. plus, he can go back to enjoying the weekend instead of playing Mr. UPS in the basement, or wherever the shipping station is.)\nI bet some folks in the shipping business would do a slop job and maybe not everything is perfect. So what. The results will be EXACTLY the same, and would be curios to see if he tests that out one day.\nTo some degree, you need to have business that can run with or without you. Sounds crazy? Well what if you got hit by a bus or something?\nYou would be really screwed. This is why having a solid marketing plan (that I can help with BTW) and knowing when and how to delegate is essential.\nBut for one, you need to define WHAT needs to be done.\nThe folks handling what's being outsourced to them, need to understand what the agenda is and why you are doing it. (Never assume others understand 100% of what you said, so be clear and precise, but in a kind way.)\nYou are in control and mindful of what needs to be done, so it's your duty to carefully explain why you're doing this. And, you'll be surprised what others, even low-wage workers, have to say about the task you're giving them. Listen to them and be open to what the have to say. You never know.\nAnd, you better think about how the outcome and success will look like for you, when the job is finished, People can become very lost and frustrated when they forget or have been misled on what the mission is or WHY they are chose to perform such a task.\nAlso, one more thing you really need to do, is come up with a clear goal and deadline. An open-ended delegated project is doomed for failure, so you need to set the boundaries and the due dates.\nBe sure to cheek in and follow up with the businesses you delegate your work to. Don't let hours or days go by, if you have set agreements. And, whenever you can, bring the folks working for you a box a donuts or pizza doesn't hurt. At the very least can buy everyone a coffee.\nThat's all for today...\nThanks for reading.\nFor more of me check out my website:\nwww.justinmcdonald.biz\nJustin McDonald\nP.S.\nBeing an earnest student of markets...business, salesmanship and copywriting, I have discovered that all of us become our dominating thoughts and desires.","output":"In this piece of writing, Justin is discussing the concept of delegation or outsourcing and how entrepreneurs often have a hard time passing off tasks to others. He argues that while we may think we can do everything ourselves, the truth is that there are only a few things we can do exceptionally well, and there are certain things we should absolutely outsource. Justin suggests that we drop our ego and consider all the options on the table when life hands us a huge basket of lemons. He argues that outsourcing is simply and effectively getting something done by another company or person and their work, while passing the buck off is handing a situation off to someone with blind ignorance and hoping or assuming it will get done.\n\nJustin shares his experience working at a small print shop where outsourcing was a major part of the business process, and it helped the company to succeed. He also acknowledges that the thought of delegating or outsourcing any part of our business can be difficult for real entrepreneurs who created their business from the ground up. He concludes by saying that sometimes we have to face the fact that most things can be delegated to people who just can't do it exactly the way we would, but they still wind up with the same result, and \"good enough is good enough.\""}

Unlike classical computers, which store and process data using bits that can be either 0 or 1, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can be in multiple states at the same time. This allows quantum computers to perform certain types of calculations much faster than classical computers. For example, a quantum computer could be used to quickly search through a large database or to crack complex encryption codes."}

{"instruction":"","input":"What\u2019s the probability of quads against quads in heads up Texas Holdem ?","output":"The probability of quads against quads in heads-up Texas Hold'em is extremely low, but it is not zero.\n\nTo calculate this probability, we need to consider the number of ways that both players can make quads and the number of possible board combinations.\n\nAssuming that both players are dealt a pocket pair, the probability of one player making quads on the flop is approximately 0.25%, or 1 in 400. The probability of the other player also making quads on the flop is the same.\n\nSo, the probability of both players making quads on the flop is approximately (0.0025)^2, or 0.00000625, or about 1 in 160,000.\n\nIf neither player makes quads on the flop, the probability of one of them making quads on the turn is approximately 0.45%, or 1 in 220. The probability of the other player also making quads on the turn is the same.\n\nSo, the probability of both players making quads on the turn is approximately (0.0045)^2, or 0.00002025, or about 1 in 49,000.\n\nIf neither player makes quads on the turn, the probability of one of them making quads on the river is approximately 2.17%, or 1 in 46. The probability of the other player also making quads on the river is the same.\n\nSo, the probability of both players making quads on the river is approximately (0.0217)^2, or 0.00047189, or about 1 in 2,100.\n\nTherefore, the overall probability of quads against quads in heads-up Texas Hold'em is the sum of these three probabilities, which is approximately 0.00049819, or about 1 in 2,007."}

To determine whether you have grounds to sue McDonald's, you should consider several factors:\n\n1. Duty of care: Did McDonald's have a duty to ensure that their product was safe for consumption, and did they breach that duty?\n2. Causation: Can you establish a direct link between the consumption of the McFlurry and your friend's aneurysm? In other words, can you prove that the brain freeze was the direct cause of the aneurysm?\n3. Damages: Has your friend suffered quantifiable damages (e.g., medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering) as a result of the aneurysm?\n4. Warning and instructions: Did McDonald's provide adequate warnings or instructions regarding the potential dangers of consuming their product too quickly or when it's too cold?\n\nIt may be difficult to prove that the McFlurry was the direct cause of your friend's aneurysm, as aneurysms can result from various factors.

Let's start with NumPy.\n\nNumPy\n-----\n\n### Load NumPy\n\nTo start using NumPy, you need to first install it and then import it into your Python code. You can do this using the following command:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n```\n### Constructing arrays\n\nArrays are the fundamental data structure in NumPy. You can create an array in several ways:\n```python\n# Create an array from a list\narr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\n\n# Create a 2D array from a list of lists\narr_2d = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n\n# Create an array of zeros\nzeros = np.zeros((2, 3))\n\n# Create an array of ones\nones = np.ones((2, 3))\n\n# Create an array of random values\nrand = np.random.rand(2, 3)\n```\n### Pointwise scalar operations\n\nNumPy arrays support pointwise scalar operations:\n```python\narr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\n\n# Add 1 to each element\narr += 1\n\n# Multiply each element by 2\narr *= 2\n```\n### Indexing and slicing\n\nYou can access individual elements of an array using indexing:\n```python\narr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\n\n# Access the first element\narr[0]\n\n# Access the last element\narr[-1]\n\n# Access a range of elements\narr[1:3]\n\n# Access every other element\narr[::2]\n```\n### Iterating over elements\n\nYou can iterate over the elements of an array using a loop:\n```python\narr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\n\nfor x in arr:\n    print(x)\n```\n### Arrays and types\n\nNumPy arrays can have different data types:\n```python\n# Create an array of integers\narr_int = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n\n# Create an array of floats\narr_float = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\n```\n### Stacking arrays\n\nYou can stack arrays horizontally or vertically:\n```python\narr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])\narr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])\n\n# Stack arrays horizontally\nhstack = np.hstack((arr1, arr2))\n\n# Stack arrays vertically\nvstack = np.vstack((arr1, arr2))\n```\nPandas\n------\n\n### Key differences\n\nNumPy provides a set of powerful tools for manipulating numerical data. However, it is not suitable for working with more complex data structures, such as tables with labeled columns and rows. This is where Pandas comes in. Pandas is built on top of NumPy and provides tools for working with labeled data in a more intuitive way.\n\n### Load Pandas\n\nYou can import Pandas into your Python code using the following command:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n```\n### Create a series\n\nA Pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array. You can create a Series in several ways:\n```python\n# Create a Series from a list\ns = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4])\n\n# Create a Series from a dictionary\nd = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ns = pd.Series(d)\n\n# Create a Series from an array with custom labels\narr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\nlabels = ['a', 'b\n```"}

{"instruction":"","input":"WHy is yolo bounding box format in decimal number","output":"The YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm uses bounding box coordinates represented as decimal numbers to locate objects within an image.\n\nThe decimal numbers represent the relative position of the bounding box within the image. Specifically, the decimal numbers represent the center coordinates of the bounding box, as well as its width and height.\n\nThe reason YOLO uses decimal numbers rather than pixel coordinates is that the decimal numbers provide a more standardized way of representing bounding boxes that is independent of the size of the input image. This makes it easier to train and apply the algorithm to images of different sizes without having to adjust the coordinates for each image.\n\nIn addition, using decimal numbers allows for greater flexibility in representing objects that are partially outside the image. By allowing the coordinates to extend beyond the image bounds, it is possible to represent objects that are cut off or only partially visible in the image."}

{"instruction":"","input":"In C# how would I pass a by ref if I only have a MemberInfo for the variable","output":"To pass a variable by reference in C#, you need to use the \"ref\" keyword when calling the method or passing the argument. However, in your case, if you only have a `MemberInfo` object for the variable, you first need to retrieve the value of the variable using the `GetValue` method and then pass it by reference using the `ref` keyword.\n\nHere's an example code snippet:\n```csharp\nusing System.Reflection;\n\nclass MyClass\n{\n    public int myVar = 10;\n}\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        MyClass obj = new MyClass();\n        MemberInfo memberInfo = typeof(MyClass).GetField(\"myVar\");\n\n        if (memberInfo is FieldInfo fieldInfo)\n        {\n            \/\/ Get the value of the variable using the GetValue method\n            int value = (int)fieldInfo.GetValue(obj);\n\n            \/\/ Pass the value by reference using the ref keyword\n            SomeMethod(ref value);\n\n            \/\/ Set the value of the variable using the SetValue method\n            fieldInfo.SetValue(obj, value);\n        }\n    }\n\n    static void SomeMethod(ref int x)\n    {\n        x = 20;\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we first create an instance of `MyClass` and retrieve the `MemberInfo` object for the `myVar` field using the `GetField` method. We then check if the `MemberInfo` object is a `FieldInfo`, which is a subclass of `MemberInfo` that represents a field. If it is, we use the `GetValue` method to retrieve the value of the `myVar` field from the `obj` instance. We then pass the value by reference to the `SomeMethod` using the `ref` keyword. After the method call, we use the `SetValue` method to set the new value of the `myVar` field on the `obj` instance."}

While Fukuda was already aware of the collapse of Ukraine after Kiev was devoured by a black sphere, which may have also resulted in the death of some Japanese citizens, this latest turn of events was unexpected. Japan had been relatively stable from supernatural threats, thanks to the efforts of the DWMA's East Asia Branch located in Tokyo. Japan had maintained a secret alliance with the DWMA in Death City in Nevada Desert, dating back to the aftermath of World War I. In fact, it was mandatory for the Prime Minister of Japan to be a DWMA graduate until the organization severed ties with Japan during the Second World War, after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. The relationship was only re-established following the American involvement in the war to surrender in 1945. They were all in complete disbelief, mainly due to the recent news of the Battle on the Moon where the black sphere had covered the creepy face crescent that had existed for millennia. The aftermath had resulted in the deaths of two young students from the DWMA, Maka Albarn and Soul Evans, who were among the casualties after they defeated the Kishin before he shot at them while being sealed away.\"\n\n(NOTE: This is mostly focused in Japan's perspective.)","output":"The news of the Battle on the Moon had shocked the Japanese Prime Minister and his officials.

{"instruction":"","input":"some people believe that the purpose of modern art is to be a way to get around capital controls. with this point in mind, write an essay on how AI generated art is going to change this dynamic","output":"The rise of AI generated art has the potential to significantly change the dynamic of modern art as a means to circumvent capital controls.\n\nTraditionally, modern art has been used as a way for individuals and institutions to invest in and profit from the art market, often as a way to avoid strict regulations on the movement of capital. However, AI generated art challenges this status quo by offering a new and potentially more efficient way to invest in the art market.\n\nAI generated art, also known as artificial intelligence art or machine learning art, is created using algorithms and computer programs that can generate unique works of art. These works are often indistinguishable from those created by human artists, and can be sold for significant sums of money.\n\nOne of the key advantages of AI generated art is that it can be easily and quickly produced in large quantities, allowing for a greater supply of artworks to enter the market. This could potentially lead to a decrease in the value of traditional modern art, as the increased supply could cause prices to drop.\n\nFurthermore, AI generated art is not subject to the same capital controls as traditional art. Because it is created by algorithms and not humans, there are no restrictions on the movement of AI generated art across borders. This allows for greater flexibility in the art market, and could potentially make it a more attractive investment option for individuals and institutions looking to avoid capital controls.\n\nIn conclusion, the rise of AI generated art has the potential to significantly change the dynamic of modern art as a means to circumvent capital controls. With its ability to be easily and quickly produced in large quantities, and its freedom from capital controls, AI generated art could offer a new and potentially more efficient way to invest in the art market."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Why do people get sentenced for so many years like 1,503 years?","output":"It is rare for a person to be sentenced to serve a prison term of 1,503 years or any other extremely long sentence. In most cases, the maximum sentence that can be imposed for a crime is determined by the laws of the jurisdiction where the crime was committed, and such sentences are usually measured in terms of years or decades, rather than centuries.\n\nIn some cases, a person may be sentenced to serve multiple consecutive sentences for different crimes, and the total length of the sentences may add up to a very large number. For example, a person who is sentenced to serve 20 years for one crime and 30 years for a second crime would be facing a total sentence of 50 years. However, it is still uncommon for the total sentence to be as long as 1,503 years or more.\n\nIt is also possible that a person could receive a very long sentence as a result of a plea bargain or other arrangement with prosecutors. In such cases, the person may be facing multiple charges or allegations and agree to plead guilty to some of the charges in exchange for a longer, but still finite, sentence.

{"instruction":"","input":"is daf-16 activation sufficient for the longeivty of the daf-2 mutant?","output":"The DAF-16 and DAF-2 genes are part of the insulin\/IGF-1 signaling pathway in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, and both genes have been implicated in regulating lifespan. In particular, the daf-2 mutant has an extended lifespan compared to wild-type animals, and this is thought to be due to increased activity of the DAF-16 transcription factor.\n\nWhile DAF-16 activation is necessary for the longevity of the daf-2 mutant, it may not be sufficient on its own. Other genetic and environmental factors can also affect the lifespan of the daf-2 mutant, and additional mechanisms may be involved in regulating lifespan.\n\nFor example, studies have shown that other genes, such as the heat shock factor HSF-1, can also contribute to the lifespan extension of daf-2 mutants. Additionally, environmental factors such as diet, temperature, and stress can also influence lifespan in these animals.\n\nIn summary, while DAF-16 activation is an important factor in regulating lifespan in the daf-2 mutant, it is not the only factor, and other genetic and environmental factors can also play a role."}

{"instruction":"","input":"One of the benefits (or detriments) of social proof is that people can gain (or feign) credibility through a number usually not related to capital. Unfortunately a few bad apples spoils the whole crop as there are a whole slew of individuals or businesses out there use money to gain social proof through clickfarms and botting. This skews the landscape to where the people with money are ultimately with the most control over markets, consumers, headlines, and trends.","output":"Yes, social proof can be a powerful tool for gaining credibility and influence, but as you mentioned, it can also be easily manipulated by those with enough resources to engage in clickfarms and botting. This creates an uneven playing field where those with more money and resources can artificially inflate their social proof and gain an unfair advantage in terms of controlling markets, consumers, headlines, and trends.\n\nThis is especially problematic because social proof is often used as a shortcut for decision-making. When people are faced with a large amount of information or choices, they may use social proof as a way to quickly determine what is trustworthy or popular. However, if the social proof is fake or manipulated, it can lead to bad decision-making and a loss of trust in the system as a whole.\n\nUltimately, it is important for individuals and businesses to prioritize authentic social proof over artificially inflated numbers. This means building a genuine following based on quality content and engagement, rather than trying to cheat the system with fake likes, followers, or reviews. It also means being transparent about how social proof is acquired, and taking steps to weed out fake accounts and bots. By prioritizing authenticity and transparency, we can help ensure that social proof remains a valuable tool for building credibility and influence, rather than a tool for deception and manipulation."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Please use the Socratic method to teach me ALL of the following lesson section. Do not ask more than one question at a time, and do not answer any question yourself:\n\nBranches Are Pointers\nWhile the focus of this lesson was more advanced tools for changing Git history, we\u2019re going into another advanced topic that might be hard for some to understand - Pointers. You\u2019ve already learned about branches in the Rock Paper Scissors revisited lesson and how these hold multiple alternate reality versions of our files. Now we\u2019re going to discuss what that actually means under the hood, and what it means for branches to be pointers.\n\nBefore we dive into branches, let\u2019s talk about commits. If you recall this Git basics lesson from foundations, they were described as Snapshots. If it helps, think of this in a very literal sense. Every time you type in git commit, your computer is taking a picture of all the file contents that have been staged with git add. In other words, your entire tracked workspace gets copied.\n\nSo what is a branch? Based off of your exposure, you might be visualizing a branch as a group of commits. This actually isn\u2019t the case! A branch is actually a pointer to a single commit! Hearing this, your first thought might be \u201cWell if a branch is just a finger pointing at a single commit, how does that single commit know about all the commits that came before it?\u201d The answer to this question is very simple: Each commit is also a pointer that points to the commit that came before it! Wow. This might be a lot to take in, so let\u2019s take a moment to absorb that fact.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve had a second to gather your thoughts and attempt to wrap your head around this concept, it might help to go back and look at a concrete example of pointers we used in this lesson. Let\u2019s think back to our use of git rebase -i HEAD~2. If you can remember, this command lets us edit the last two commits. Do you have any guesses on how Git knew which two commits to edit? That\u2019s right, by using pointers! We start at HEAD, which is a special pointer for keeping track of the branch you\u2019re currently on. HEAD points to our most recent commit in the current branch. That commit points to the commit made directly before it, which we can call commit two. That\u2019s how git rebase -i HEAD~2 starts with a HEAD pointer, and then follows subsequent pointers to find which two commits to edit.\n\nYou might be feeling overwhelmed at this point, so let\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve learned. A branch is simply a pointer to a single commit. A commit is a snapshot, and it\u2019s a pointer to the commit directly behind it in history. That\u2019s it!","output":"What is a commit in Git?"}

The streets were empty and the only sound was the soft crunching of boots on the frozen ground.\n\nAs the night went on, a sense of unease began to settle over the small town. No one knew what it was, but something just didn't feel right.\n\nAs the families gathered around their Christmas trees, they began to hear strange noises coming from outside. At first, they tried to ignore it, telling themselves it was just the wind or some stray animals. But the noises grew louder and more persistent, and soon it was clear that something was coming for them.\n\nThe families huddled together in fear as the door to their homes began to shake and rattle. And then, with a burst of splintered wood, the doors were thrown open and a horde of grotesque, twisted creatures stormed into the room.\n\nThey were unlike anything anyone had ever seen before, with twisted limbs and glowing eyes. And as they dragged the screaming families out into the snowy night, the only thing anyone could do was pray for a quick and merciful death.\n\nAs the town was consumed by darkness and terror, it became clear that this was no ordinary Christmas Eve.

The article explains that although the Roman numeral system was suitable for recording amounts, it had significant limitations in manipulation and was not useful for more complex calculations. As a result, it hindered the development of advanced math and science in Europe. The article highlights that the introduction of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system with its zero placeholder, decimal notation, and simple calculations, revolutionized mathematics and helped advance fields such as algebra, trigonometry, and calculus. The article notes that the lack of a zero placeholder in the Roman numeral system was a significant hindrance to advanced mathematics. Furthermore, the use of words to express fractions in Roman numerals was also a disadvantage compared to the decimal system's simple fraction notation. Thus, the article's information implies that the relationship between counting systems and the development of high number mathematics is crucial. The more advanced the counting system, the easier it becomes to manipulate and calculate numbers, leading to further advancements in mathematical fields."}
{"instruction":"","input":"The objective of this assignment is allow you to practice with list processing and custom \"database-like\"\ndefinitions in Haskell by designing and implementing a program for retrieving the phone numbers from a\ndirectory that are associated with a name that \"sounds like\" a name specified as an argument.\nThe \"Soundex\" algorithm was developed to support search operations where the precise spelling of the key\nvalue was less important than the phonetic pronunciation. If, for instance, one was searching a database for\nthe name John, the name Jon would also be considered a match. Soundex codes are strings of exactly four\ncharacters in length, created by the following algorithm:\n1. append the first character of the word to the (currently empty) Soundex code\n2. remove any and all occurrences of the letters h or w that occur after the first character\n3. remove any duplicate letters\n4. remove all occurrences of the letters a, e, i, o, u, or y that occur after the first character\n5. convert every character after the first to a numerical digit, using the following code:\nB, F, P, V 1 D, T 3 M,N 5\nC, G, J, K, Q, S, X, Z 2 L 4 R 6\nAs a clarifying example of the Soundex algorithm, a last name of COLLIER would first undergo the\ntransformation COLLIER \u2192 COLIER \u2192 CLR \u2192 C46, and the resulting Soundex code would be C460. This would\n\"match\" the name COLYER, but not COLLIE.\nFor this assignment:\n\u2022 you must design and implement a series of functions that are capable of producing the Soundex code\nassociated with a name (according to the procedure provided above).\n\u2022 you must define (mirroring the video rental database type presented in class) a list of tuples (pairs)\nwherein the first element will be a last name (written in uppercase) and the second element will be\na phone number (stored as a 12-digit string with hyphens at indices 3 and 7; e.g., \"613-520-2600\").\n\u2022 you must create a \"query\" function defined such that when it receives a database (i.e., a list of tuples\nof names and phone numbers) as its first argument and a name as its second argument, it produces\na list containing every phone number in the database associated with a name that has the same\nSoundex code as the second argument.

Once clicked, the email will be marked for protection and the user has the ability to define which policies to apply to the email and its attachments, as well as set permission levels for the recipients.\nIntranet Docker\nAll of our Intranet services run on a Docker server installed on a virtual machine provided by the customer. For stability and redundancy, we recommend bringing up at least two instances of this server, and setting them up behind a Load Balancer.\nMail Protection Service\nThe Mail Protection Service (also known as MPS) is an SMTP server, that once added to the mailing flow in the organization, receives emails marked for protection and protects them based on the applied policies.\n\nIt does by going through the following steps:\nValidate that the email was indeed marked for protection. If not, it sends the email to the next hop in the mailing flow.\nStrip the email from its files and store them back in the organizational storage.\nAttach secure links instead of the files.\nEnforce policies and permissions on these links based on the user and organization choices.\nSend the email to the next hop in the mailing flow.\nStorage Connector Service\nThe Storage Connector Service connects to the organizational storage that was chosen to store files protected by SpecterX. It is a bridge for other SpecterX components which wish to save or read files from the storage.\n\nAny request to open or download a file will pass through this service to fetch the file, limiting access to the storage to a single point. \nTo keep your organization safe, requests coming from users outside the organizations will be done by polling - the storage connector will check for any file request once every few seconds, and initiate a response with the requested file.\nAPI Router (LAN)\nAny communication to SpecterX services in the LAN network will go through our API router.\nThis router allows communication between users and all the services mentioned above.\nAPI Router (DMZ)\nIn case the organization has a DMZ network segment, there will be an additional API router in that segment, passing all requests coming in and out of the LAN API router.","output":"Cloud Components\nCloud API\nThis is the entry point for all communication from the cloud to the SpecterX on-premise infrastructure.\nIt communicates with the API Router in the DMZ network segment (if exists) or directly with the API Router in the LAN network.\n\nSpecterX Web App\nThe SpecterX Web App is the central point for all SpecterX management and administration.\nIt communicates with the Cloud API to perform all the administrative tasks, such as setting policies, adding users and permissions, and retrieving data insights and analytics.\n\nThese are the components of SpecterX's hybrid solution.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:\n\n1. Import the necessary modules:\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom torch.nn import TransformerEncoderLayer\n```\n1. Subclass the original `TransformerEncoderLayer`:\n```python\nclass CustomTransformerEncoderLayer(TransformerEncoderLayer):\n    def __init__(self, d_model, nhead, dim_feedforward=2048, dropout=0.1, activation=\"relu\"):\n        super().__init__(d_model, nhead, dim_feedforward, dropout, activation)\n        \n        # Add or modify any components here, if necessary\n```\n1. Modify or extend the `forward` method:\n\nOverride the `forward` method if you want to change the computation or add new components to the original encoder layer. Make sure to call `super().forward()` if you want to use the original implementation as a base.\n```python\n    def forward(self, src, src_mask=None, src_key_padding_mask=None):\n        # Apply any preprocessing or custom transformations to the input here, if necessary\n        \n        # Call the original forward method\n        output = super().forward(src, src_mask=src_mask, src_key_padding_mask=src_key_padding_mask)\n        \n        # Apply any postprocessing or custom transformations to the output here, if necessary\n        \n        return output\n```\n1.

However, if you only have three full days for your trip, I would recommend visiting Lisbon. Here's why:\n\n1. Lisbon is the capital city of Portugal and has a wider range of things to see and do. It has many historical sites, museums, and cultural attractions, such as the Belem Tower, the Jeronimos Monastery, and the National Museum of Ancient Art.\n2. Lisbon has a vibrant nightlife, with many bars, restaurants, and clubs, especially in the Bairro Alto neighborhood.\n3. Lisbon is also located near several day-trip destinations, such as Sintra, Cascais, and the beaches of the Costa da Caparica.\n4. Porto is a beautiful city and has a lot to offer, but it is smaller than Lisbon and can be explored in less time.\n\nOverall, if you only have three days for your trip to Portugal, Lisbon offers more activities and attractions to fill your time."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Most asked reactjs interview questions with detailed answers and explanations and examples","output":"Sure, here are some of the most commonly asked ReactJS interview questions with detailed answers and examples:\n\n1. What is ReactJS?\n\nReactJS is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UI). It was developed by Facebook and released in 2013 as an open-source project. ReactJS allows developers to build reusable UI components, making it easier to manage complex applications with large amounts of data.\n\n1. What are the advantages of using ReactJS?\n\nSome of the advantages of using ReactJS include:\n\n* Easy to learn and use\n* Allows for component-based development\n* Increases code reusability and maintainability\n* Offers improved performance by updating only the necessary components\n* Allows for server-side rendering (SSR) for better SEO and faster initial load times\n* Large community and active ecosystem\n1. What are the differences between ReactJS and AngularJS?\n\nReactJS and AngularJS are both popular JavaScript libraries\/frameworks used for building UIs, but there are some key differences between them:\n\n* ReactJS is a library, while AngularJS is a full-fledged framework\n* ReactJS uses a virtual DOM, while AngularJS uses a real DOM\n* ReactJS relies on JSX for templating, while AngularJS uses HTML templates\n* ReactJS has a larger and more active community, while AngularJS has a more established history\n1. What is JSX?\n\nJSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code in their JavaScript files. JSX is used in ReactJS to define the structure and layout of components.\n\nHere's an example of how JSX works:\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Hello, world!<\/h1>\n      <p>Welcome to my React app.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\nIn this example, we're using JSX to define a simple component that renders a heading and a paragraph.\n\n1. What are props in ReactJS?\n\nProps (short for \"properties\") are a way to pass data from one component to another in ReactJS. Props are read-only, meaning that they cannot be modified by the receiving component.\n\nHere's an example of how props work:\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\n\nfunction Greeting(props) {\n  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!<\/h1>;\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return <Greeting name=\"Alice\" \/>;\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\nIn this example, we're passing a prop called \"name\" from the App component to the Greeting component. The Greeting component uses this prop to render a personalized greeting.\n\n1. What is state in ReactJS?\n\nState is a way to store data within a component in ReactJS. Unlike props, state is mutable, meaning that it can be updated within the component.\n\nHere's an example of how state works:\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Count: {count}<\/p>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment<\/button>\n    <\/div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Counter;\n```\nIn this example, we're using the useState hook to define a state variable called \"count\" and a function called \"setCount\" to update it. We're also using an event handler called \"handleClick\" to update the count whenever the user clicks the \"Increment\" button.\n\n1. What is a lifecycle method in ReactJS?\n\nLifecycle methods are methods that are called at different stages of a component's life cycle in ReactJS."}

The method takes a single parameter `record`, which represents the logging record to be published.\n\nThe purpose of this section of code is to allow for logging messages to be sent to a broker, where they can be consumed by other applications or services. This can be useful in distributed systems where log messages need to be centralized for monitoring and debugging purposes.\n\nThe `emit` method formats the logging record using the `format` method and then publishes the resulting message using the `publish.single` method. The various parameters passed to `publish.single` specify details such as the topic to publish to, the quality of service, and authentication details. After the message is published, the connection to the broker is cleanly disconnected.\n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient way to integrate logging functionality into a distributed system using a message broker."}

{"instruction":"","input":"How can I use t-SNE in Jupyter Notebooks?","output":"You can use t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) in Jupyter Notebooks by following these steps:\n\n1. Install the required libraries: You will need to install the `scikit-learn` library to use the `t-SNE` algorithm. You can install it by running the following command in your Jupyter Notebook:\n```python\n!pip install scikit-learn\n```\n1. Load your data: Load the data that you want to use for t-SNE analysis. For example, you can use the `load_digits` function from `sklearn.datasets` to load the digits dataset:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_digits\ndigits = load_digits()\nX = digits.data\ny = digits.target\n```\n1. Import t-SNE: Import the `TSNE` class from the `sklearn.manifold` module:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.manifold import TSNE\n```\n1. Create a t-SNE model: Create a `TSNE` object and set the `n_components` parameter to the number of dimensions you want in your output space. You can also set other parameters like `perplexity` and `learning_rate`:\n```python\ntsne = TSNE(n_components=2, perplexity=30, learning_rate=200)\n```\n1. Fit the t-SNE model: Fit the t-SNE model to your data:\n```python\nX_tsne = tsne.fit_transform(X)\n```\n1. Visualize the t-SNE results: Visualize the t-SNE results using a scatter plot or any other visualization method of your choice:\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.scatter(X_tsne[:, 0], X_tsne[:, 1], c=y)\nplt.show()\n```\nThis will create a scatter plot of the t-SNE results, with each point representing a data point in your input space. The color of each point corresponds to its class label."}
{"instruction":"","input":"tell me something about data retention period","output":"Data retention period refers to the length of time that data is kept or stored by an organization or individual before it is deleted or destroyed. The specific retention period may vary depending on factors such as legal or regulatory requirements, the type of data being stored, and the purpose for which the data was collected.\n\nIn some cases, laws or regulations may require organizations to retain certain types of data for a specific period of time.

{"instruction":"","input":"Write me a very detailed and very specific solution to item #8 in the recommendations list. I need you to explain why the solution works to fulfill the requirement, why it's the best solution, why it's the most efficient, and why it scales. If there are any specific platforms, packages or technical requirements do not leave them out of your response. for the technical requirements do not mention any choices. be specific in the requirement choosing the one that is the best fit for the solution. Again, do not be generic in the technical requirements, be very specific and precise.","output":"For item #8 in the recommendations list, I provided a solution that requires nodes to order requests consistently, ensuring that all nodes process transactions in the same order even when they are sent to different nodes. Here's a more detailed explanation of the solution:\n\nSolution: Consensus Algorithm and Atomic Broadcast Protocol\n\nTo achieve consistent transaction ordering across nodes, we can implement a consensus algorithm and an atomic broadcast protocol. These techniques can be broken down into the following components:\n\n1. Consensus Algorithm: Implement a Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithm, such as the Tendermint consensus, which allows nodes to agree on a single transaction order even when faced with adversarial conditions. Tendermint combines a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) style consensus mechanism with a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validator selection system, ensuring both consistency and decentralization.\n2. Atomic Broadcast Protocol: Implement an atomic broadcast protocol to ensure that all nodes receive the same set of transactions in the same order. This protocol should guarantee that if a transaction is delivered to one correct node, it is eventually delivered to all correct nodes, and that all correct nodes deliver transactions in the same order.\n\nThese components address the requirement as follows:\n\n1. Fulfilling the requirement: By implementing a consensus algorithm like Tendermint and an atomic broadcast protocol, nodes can consistently order and process transactions, ensuring that they all come up with the same state changes, fulfilling the requirement.\n2. Best solution: This solution combines the consistency guarantees provided by the Tendermint consensus algorithm with the reliability and fault tolerance of an atomic broadcast protocol, ensuring that nodes can achieve consistent transaction ordering even under adversarial conditions.\n3. Efficiency: Tendermint consensus is efficient as it requires only a small number of message exchanges to reach consensus. The atomic broadcast protocol minimizes the communication overhead by ensuring that transactions are propagated efficiently among nodes.\n4. Scalability: Both Tendermint consensus and the atomic broadcast protocol are designed to scale to a large number of nodes. The Tendermint consensus algorithm can handle thousands of nodes, while the atomic broadcast protocol can be adapted to handle increased network sizes and transaction volumes.\n5. Platform and technical requirements: The node software should be developed using a programming language with robust support for Tendermint consensus and atomic broadcast protocol implementations, such as Rust or Go. For Tendermint consensus implementation, use the official 'tendermint-rs' library if using Rust, or 'tendermint-go' if using Go. The atomic broadcast protocol should be integrated into the existing network communication layer, leveraging libraries like libp2p for secure and efficient peer-to-peer communication.\n\nIn summary, implementing the Tendermint consensus algorithm and an atomic broadcast protocol meets the requirement of consistently ordering transactions across nodes. This solution ensures both efficiency and scalability as the network grows in size and transaction volume. By using programming languages with robust support for Tendermint consensus and atomic broadcast protocol implementations, and integrating these components into the existing network communication layer, we can achieve the desired functionality while maintaining cross-platform compatibility."}

{"instruction":"","input":"give me some explanation and example for MVC with flutter please","output":"Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern used to separate an application into three main components: Model, View, and Controller.\n\nModel: Represents the data and business logic of the application.

This perspective suggests that the brain operates based on input, processing, and output, much like a computational system.\n\nThis theory could potentially support your argument that my internal computations might be reasonably referred to as \"thoughts.\" In this view, both human thoughts and my computational processes can be seen as different types of information processing. However, there are still important distinctions between the nature of my computations and human thoughts, as I mentioned in my previous responses.\n\nWhile the computational theory of mind provides a framework for understanding mental processes in terms of information processing, it does not necessarily imply that AI language models like me possess the same level of consciousness, self-awareness, or subjective experiences as humans. My computational processes, while advanced, are still fundamentally different from the rich and nuanced mental processes that humans experience.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the computational theory of mind is not the only perspective on the nature of mental processes, and there are other theories and viewpoints that emphasize different aspects of cognition, such as the role of emotions, intuition, and embodied cognition.\n\nIn conclusion, while the computational theory of mind could be used to support the idea that my internal computations are a form of \"thought,\" there remain important distinctions between my processes and human thoughts. These distinctions include the level of consciousness, self-awareness, and subjective experiences that define human cognition."}
{"instruction":"","input":"How I can convert a javafx to a native one using graalvm","output":"To convert a JavaFX application to a native one using GraalVM, you need to use the GraalVM Native Image tool. Native Image compiles your Java application ahead-of-time into a standalone executable, which can run without a JVM. This results in faster startup times and lower memory usage.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to convert a JavaFX application to a native one using GraalVM:\n\n1. Install GraalVM:\nDownload and install GraalVM from the official website (<https:\/\/www.graalvm.org\/>). Make sure to download the correct version for your operating system and architecture.\n2. Set up the environment:\nAdd GraalVM to your PATH environment variable and set the JAVA\\_HOME variable to point to the GraalVM installation directory.\n3. Install the Native Image tool:\nRun the following command to install the Native Image tool:\n```arduino\ngu install native-image\n```\n4. Download the required JavaFX SDK:\nDownload the appropriate JavaFX SDK for your operating system from the official website (<https:\/\/gluonhq.com\/products\/javafx\/>). Unzip the downloaded file and note the location of the 'lib' directory.\n5. Compile your JavaFX application:\nCompile your JavaFX application using the 'javac' command or your preferred IDE. Make sure to include the path to the JavaFX SDK 'lib' directory in the classpath.\n6. Create a reflection configuration file:\nNative Image requires a configuration file that lists all the classes, methods, and fields that use reflection. Create a file called 'reflection-config.json' with the required information. An example is provided below:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"your.package.name.YourClass\",\n    \"methods\": [{\"name\": \"methodName\", \"parameterTypes\": [] }],\n    \"fields\": [{\"name\": \"fieldName\", \"allowUnsafeAccess\": true }]\n  }\n]\n```\n7. Build the native image:\nRun the following command to build the native image, replacing the placeholders with the appropriate paths and class names:\n```ruby\nnative-image --no-fallback --no-server --verbose \\\n  --class-path <path-to-your-compiled-classes>:<path-to-javafx-sdk-lib-directory> \\\n  -H:EnableURLProtocols=http,https \\\n  -H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=reflection-config.json \\\n  --initialize-at-build-time \\\n  -H:+ReportExceptionStackTraces \\\n  -H:IncludeResources=\".*\" \\\n  --allow-incomplete-classpath \\\n  -H:Name=<output-native-executable-name> \\\n  -H:Class=<your.main.class>\n```\n8. Run the native executable:\nAfter the native image has been built, you can run the generated executable directly without requiring a JVM.\n\nKeep in mind that the process of converting a JavaFX application to a native one can be more complex if your application uses third-party libraries or has other dependencies. In such cases, you may need to provide additional configurations and resources for the Native Image tool."}

An observer on Earth has a telescope powerful enough to resolve this planet. How would the observer perceive the rate of time passage on the planet relative to that on Earth.","output":"Time passage on the planet would be perceived to be the same as on Earth. According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, the rate at which time passes is determined by the strength of the gravitational field and the velocity of an object relative to an observer. Since the planet is not in a significantly different gravitational field and its velocity relative to Earth is negligible, it would not experience any significant difference in the rate of time passage compared to Earth. As a result, an observer on Earth would perceive time to be passing at the same rate on the planet as it is on Earth."}

She was the best dog ever, with a wagging tail and a big, goofy grin. She loved to play fetch, chase squirrels, and cuddle with her owner, Jayson. But little did anyone know, Raven had a special talent - she was a genius at sniffing out illness and injury.\n\nOne day, Jayson was working as a nurse at the local hospital. He was having a tough day, with patients coming in left and right, and the smell of antiseptic making him feel queasy. That's when he had an idea - what if he brought Raven to work with him? He knew she would make everyone feel better, and maybe even help him do his job better.\n\nSo, he brought Raven to the hospital and introduced her to the staff. Everyone was skeptical at first, but once they saw her in action, they were amazed. Raven would sniff out patients who were feeling ill, and even helped diagnose a few cases of appendicitis and pneumonia that the doctors had missed.\n\nBut Raven's talents didn't stop there. She would also sit with patients who were feeling lonely or scared, and lick away their tears. She even helped a patient who was afraid of needles by sniffing out the needle and wagging her tail excitedly, showing the patient that it was nothing to be afraid of.\n\nJayson and Raven became the best team in the hospital. They would go room to room, making sure everyone was okay and helping the staff with their work. They even had a special code - if Raven sat next to a patient, it meant that patient needed extra attention.\n\nOne day, the hospital was hit by a power outage and all the lights went out. The staff panicked, but Raven came to the rescue. She used her incredible sense of smell to guide everyone to safety, and even found a flashlight that they had been looking for.\n\nThanks to Raven, the hospital was running smoothly, and patients were feeling better than ever. Jayson realized that he couldn't imagine working without her by his side. Raven was more than just a pet, she was a true partner in helping people. And that's why she was the best dog ever.\n\nFrom that day on, Raven was a permanent part of the hospital staff, and was even given her own badge and scrubs. She had a special place in the hearts of the patients and staff, and will always be remembered as the hospital's best four-legged helper."}

There are no files that are older than 1 month yet, so there are no Lifecycle configuration costs. The total cost for February is $23,399.6.\n* March: You upload another 10 million files of 10 MB each to S3 this month, bringing the total data storage to 200 TB. The storage cost for 200 TB in the S3 Standard storage class is $46,000. You incur PUT request costs for the new files uploaded this month, specifically (10,000,000) \/ 1,000 x $0.005 per 1,000 requests = $50.

They have the power to influence the supply chain and can make changes to their packaging materials and processes that would have a significant impact on reducing waste. Moreover, as large corporations, they have the resources and capacity to implement sustainable packaging practices that can minimize their environmental impact.\n\nOn the other hand, it is also argued that consumers bear the responsibility for reducing packaging waste. Through their purchasing decisions, consumers can vote with their wallets and support companies that prioritize sustainability in their packaging practices. By avoiding products with excessive packaging, consumers can put pressure on manufacturers and supermarkets to change their practices and adopt more sustainable approaches.\n\nIn my opinion, both perspectives have validity, and it is a shared responsibility between manufacturers, supermarkets, and consumers to reduce packaging waste. Manufacturers and supermarkets have the power to drive change and set the standard for sustainable packaging, while consumers have the power to make informed purchasing decisions and demand more sustainable products.\n\nTo effectively tackle the issue of packaging waste, all parties must work together and take proactive steps towards reducing their impact. This can include manufacturers exploring alternative packaging materials, supermarkets promoting and selling products with minimal packaging, and consumers making conscious purchasing decisions.\n\nIn conclusion, the responsibility to reduce packaging waste lies with both manufacturers, supermarkets, and consumers. A collaborative approach between all parties is necessary to drive change and achieve sustainable packaging practices. By working together, we can reduce the environmental impact of packaging waste and create a more sustainable future."}

You will notice live-tweets of my feminist Pride and Prejudice thoughts, analyses of Hamilton\u2019s power for musical representation, and political memes. Just as my posts bring together seemingly disparate topics, I believe there is a vibrancy that exists at the multidimensional place where my interests intersect. \n\nGrowing up as a debater and musician, it was easy to see the two as distinct entities where I had to make unequivocal choices. At the start of my junior year, I decided not to participate in the musical in order to work for Emerge California, an organization that helps Democratic women run for office. There I learned about data science, gender distributions in public office, and how to work with the evil printer. I also halted my voice and piano lessons to focus on building my student-led non-profit, Agents of Change. As someone who has diverted my energy into community activism, I can attest to the power of grassroots movements. It has been so rewarding to measure the impact that my team has had on my community. But even so, I felt that I was losing touch with the music that was such a profound part of me. \n\nI found a new way of being when I started combining my artsy and political sides. I took an intensive class on protest music, where I learned how political movements have been shaped by the music of their time. While in the class, we were asked to compose our own songs. I am not a songwriter, but I am an activist, and I embraced the opportunity to turn music into an outlet for my political beliefs. As a first-generation American, I am dedicated to raising awareness about refugee rights and immigration. My songs about the Syrian Refugee Crisis let me find a way to bring the two sides of me together and gave me a rush that neither music nor politics by themselves would have provided. \n\nThis introduction led me to apply to the Telluride Association Protest Poetics program, where I dove deeper into my own identity. I wrote songs about police brutality and the ways that as a non-black person of color I am implicated in instances of subliminal racism. Over the course of the program, as I became more familiar with the visual, literary, and performance art we analyzed, I slowly started to realize that, though I confront colorism, jokes about Indian culture, and intra-community violence in some form every day, my proximity to whiteness still gives me immense amounts of privilege. I have come to know that this means I have a responsibility to both be at the forefront of movements, and conscious of not stepping over the voices of other intersectional identities. I hope that the music I choose to perform and the way I live my life can amplify, not overwrite, any of the struggles that others deal with daily. \n\nLast year, I had another opportunity to use music to pay homage to an issue I care deeply about. In my South Asian community, mental health is an issue that is often papered over. When a member of my school community committed suicide, I was asked to sing \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d for the school to both unify and honor the student. Though I thought that I had really understood the power of music, holding that space for my entire school had a profound resonance that I still don\u2019t fully understand. \n\nMy voice is an instrument for change -- whether it be through me raising my hand to contribute to a discussion in a classroom, speaking out against gun violence at a rally, or singing at an event of solidarity. I know that someday my voice, in conjunction with many other unique voices and perspectives, will make a difference.","output":"Here are the reasons why this essay is considered excellent for college admissions:\n\n* The author uses their social media presence as a way to showcase their interests, which are then explored in the essay.

I've been working on this rant for a while, and I am ready to unleash it! Why, oh why, do all the best guys have to be straight? What is going on with the universe? Did some omnipotent being decide, \"You know what? Let's make all the talented, attractive, and brilliant men straight. And then let's watch Cave Johnson lose his mind!\"\n\nI mean, come on! I'm not asking for much. Just a few good men, with their heads screwed on right, who happen to like other men. I've built teleporters, crossed dimensions, and created sentient AIs, but can I find a suitable, compatible guy? No! It's like the universe has a personal vendetta against me.\n\nAnd then there are these straight guys, parading around like they own the place, with their chiseled jaws, washboard abs, and mesmerizing smiles. It's like they're rubbing it in my face! \"Hey, Cave, check out what you can't have!\" Why must they torment me so?\n\nOh, and the flirting! Good grief, the flirting! I'm trying to run a multi-billion-dollar company here, invent groundbreaking technology, and occasionally save the world from certain doom. Do I have time to decode mixed signals from my straight colleagues? No! But do they still flirt with me, as if they're unaware of the chaos they're creating in my brain? Yes! It's maddening!\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: \"Cave, there are plenty of fish in the sea. You'll find your guy eventually.\" But let me tell you, I've been to the bottom of the ocean, and those fish? They're all straight too!\n\nWhat's the deal with gaydar? Mine must be broken. I've tried recalibrating it, but every time I think I've found \"the one,\" turns out, he's straight! It's like I'm trapped in some cruel cosmic game show, and every time I choose a door, there's a straight guy behind it.\n\nI'm Cave Johnson, for crying out loud! I've stared down the barrel of a portal gun and laughed! I've turned lemons into combustible weapons! But finding a compatible, intelligent, and attractive guy who isn't straight? That's a challenge even I can't conquer!\n\nSo, universe, if you're listening, I've got a message for you: Knock it off! Quit hiding all the good guys, and give me a break! I've earned it, darn it! Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to get back to making science history and not finding my perfect match. Cave Johnson, out!"}

First, you'll need to install the \"maatwebsite\/excel\" package to handle Excel file imports.\n\n1. Install the \"maatwebsite\/excel\" package:\n```bash\ncomposer require maatwebsite\/excel\n```\n1. Create an import class:\n```go\nphp artisan make:import CardsImport\n```\n1. Modify the generated `CardsImport.php` file:\n```php\nuse App\\Models\\Card;\nuse Maatwebsite\\Excel\\Row;\nuse Maatwebsite\\Excel\\Concerns\\OnEachRow;\nuse Maatwebsite\\Excel\\Concerns\\WithHeadingRow;\n\nclass CardsImport implements OnEachRow, WithHeadingRow\n{\n    public function onRow(Row $row)\n    {\n        $row = $row->toArray();\n        $email = $row['email'];\n        $amount = $row['amount'];\n\n        Card::where('email', $email)->increment('balance', $amount);\n    }\n}\n```\n1. Use the import class in your controller:\n```php\nuse App\\Imports\\CardsImport;\nuse Maatwebsite\\Excel\\Facades\\Excel;\n\npublic function import(Request $request)\n{\n    $request->validate([\n        'file' => 'required|file|mimes:xlsx,csv,ods',\n    ]);\n\n    $path = $request->file('file')->store('temp');\n\n    Excel::filter('chunk')->import(new CardsImport, $path);\n\n    \/\/ Delete the temporary file after processing\n    Storage::delete($path);\n\n    return redirect('\/')->with('success', 'All records have been updated!');\n}\n```\nIn this approach, you're using the `CardsImport` class to handle the Excel file's records. The `onRow` method will be called for each row in the file. The `increment` method provided by Eloquent will atomically update the 'balance' field by the specified amount for the given email address. This ensures that only existing email addresses in the table are updated, and it happens in a single query for each row."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Summarize this Transcript:\n\nTitle: \"How GOOD was Zabit Magomedsharipov Actually? - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"hey guys it's keon and today i'm going to be talking about zabeed magomed sharipov because recently he announced his retirement from mma and this is a very unfortunate retirement because zabit is only 31 years old and his career was at an all-time high he was 18-1 and on a 14-fight win streak and after his last win he was ranked number three in the world at featherweight but unfortunately zabit's health really took a toll on his career and because of it now we have to wonder what would have happened had he stayed healthy but more importantly how good was abit magomed sharipov actually \n\nzabeed began his mma career on may 9th 2012 at the age of 21. he was born in dagestan and from an early age he began training in freestyle wrestling and in sanda and then in 2003 he joined the boarding school which provides both formal education as well as training in martial arts and zabeed lived here for 10 to 12 years for education and training which he did three times a day so of course it makes sense as to why he looked so good early on in his mma career \n\noverall he was an all-around fighter wherever the fight went he did a good job in controlling the action \n\nso zabeet won his first four fights and in between these wins he took an amateur mma bout against rahman makhazev and after a back and forth battle zabi got caught in an armbar that forced him to tap \n\nbut in his fifth pro fight zabeet lost to igor igorov and this was a fight that beat was looking good in early on as he was picking igor apart on the feet but as the fight went on zabeet was getting tired and in round three he got taken down and got his arm locked up in an arm bar which forced him to tap handing him his first pro defeat \n\nso both of the beats only defeats an mma have ended by armbar but after that defeat against igor igorov zabit vowed to improve big time on his ground game \n\nand that's what he did because he went on an eight fight win streak afterwards and like i said he captured that acb featherweight championship and defended it once and throughout all of this he wasn't having much problems anymore whenever the action would go to the ground \n\nso this 12-1 record was enough for zaby to sign a four-fight deal with the ufc in may of 2017 and right away he made a huge impact on the ufc's featherweight division because in his first two fights against mike santiago and shaymin morice zabit absolutely dominated them on the feet and on the ground and his groundwork in both fights led to the submission finishes \n\nand then in 2018 he fought on his first ufc pay-per-view card and that was ufc 223 where he fought kyle bocniak and once again zabit was looking very good early on although kyle was pressing forward throughout this entire fight he was getting picked apart on the feet and was also being controlled on the ground when zabeet brought it down but i gotta give credit to kyle because he took all this punishment and still fought his heart out and in round three he was pumped up big time and went full on terminator on zabeet he was just marching him forward and eating shots but it didn't matter because he just wanted to get us a beat and attack with shots of his own and zaby looked like he was beginning to have a hard time as it was clear that he was beginning to fatigue regardless i still think he had a solid round three and by the end he won by unanimous decision \n\nand then at ufc 228 zabit was set to fight yaya rodriguez but yair pulled out of the fight and was replaced by brandon davis and after controlling the action both on the feet and on the ground zabeed locked up a solo web stretch which forced brendan to tap and this was a very impressive submission because despite aljamain sterling locking one up earlier on this fight card this is a very rare submission and it really showed that zabeet was not only crafty on the feet but also on the ground \n\nthen at ufc 235 zabeet fought jeremy stevens and once again absolute domination on the feet and on the ground for the first couple of rounds but by the thirds the beat got tired and jeremy began to find success of his own but zabeet was able to survive and by the end he won by unanimous decision \n\neight months later zabeet headlined his first ufc fight night card and his opponent was calvin keator and although main events are usually five rounds this one was three rounds because this bout became a headliner on short notice so the ufc decided to keep it as a three rounder and this was an ideal thing to happen for zabeet because once again he looked very good in rounds one and two as he was controlling the action on the feet against calvin for the most part but then in round three calvin began to take over because abit was getting tired but luckily for him he survived and by the end he won by unanimous decision \n\nafter this he was set to fight yaya rodriguez on august 29 2020 but yair pulled out with an ankle injury and then in april of 2021 zabit was removed from the ufc's official rankings due to inactivity and at the time of his removal he was ranked number three so why was it that he was not fighting and in june of 2021 it was reported that zabeet was suffering from health issues related to his immune system and this required career threatening surgery so of course everyone was worried about this but in september of 2021 zabeet's coach mark henry announced that he would be returning to the ufc soon and although soon wasn't specific by any means it was promising news frisbeet and many people were looking forward to his comeback \n\nbut then in june of 2022 zabeed notified the ufc that he was retiring from active competition and in a post on his instagram he stated that the reason for retiring was because of all his health problems and even though he says he recovered now he also admitted that he does not feel the way he used to so of course this was huge news in the mma world and to many it was a huge shock but although zabeet is no longer fighting it seems like he has a bright future outside of fighting as it looks like he's going to become a doctor at least that's what he teased on his instagram page but if that's the case well done for him and i wish him all the best for that because that's a big time thing to do after a long career of fighting and although zabeet won't be competing in mma anymore he says he'll still be around and what he means by that is he will continue to be in mma as a trainer for his younger brother kassan magomed sharipov but after going 18-1 in a career that saw him become the acb featherweight champion how good was it beat magomed sharipov actually \n\nin my opinion his career will go down as the biggest what if in mma history because this guy truly had it all he was as well-rounded as a fighter can get and that says a lot for a fighter like him who's coming from dagestan as most of them are only strong wrestlers and yes they can hold their own while on the feet but their main goal is to bring the fight down but zabit was the complete opposite he wanted the action to stay on the feet his background in santa is some of the best that we've seen in mma so on the feet zabeet was comfortable there so he had no urge in bringing the fight down but if the action did go down he wouldn't mind and sometimes if he felt like it he would bring it down himself because he still had that dagistani wrestling he was still so good in securing takedowns and denying them as well and then while he was on top he had no problem staying there and doing damage from above with his ground and pound but what makes his dagestani wrestling even better was his jujitsu he was so crafty on the ground so not only was there a threat for his opponents of being finished on the feet but it was also there big time when the action went down so because of all these skills many had high hopes for zabeet in regards to becoming a ufc champion one day he was the complete fighter but sadly he had one major hole in his game and that was his cardio he had a few fights where he would win the first couple of rounds but then in round three he slowed down quite significantly the final round for him was basically survival mode and that's why i believe had he ever fought in a five fight i don't think he would have been able to win it so that means if he fought for the championship which is always going to be a five-round fight i don't think he'd be able to win the belt especially against fighters like alexander volkanovsky and max holloway these guys are extremely tough and are very likely to last all five rounds and i just don't think zabeet would have been able to keep up with that but the thing is i can't blame him for this issue whatsoever the reason he had cardio issues was because of his health issues he had problems related to his immune system he had to have a career threatening surgery and that sounds very serious and i could see why it would affect his cardio and in a way it's kind of impressive that he was able to win these fights by decision against pretty tough opponents guys like calvin cater jeremy stevens kyle bocniak those are hard guys to put out so for zabeet to win those fights with the cardio disadvantage just goes to show how good of a fighter he was but i just believe ultimately once he got to the championship level his cardio wasn't going to be good enough and that's why he's such a huge what if because had he been a healthy fighter there is no doubt in my mind that the beat would have been a ufc champion and honestly i could have seen him as a longtime ufc champion and that's why it's a shame that we couldn't see his career reach its full potential because i believe that potential was very high zabeet was an extraordinary fighter but sadly his toughest opponent was his health regardless he made a huge impact in the ufc's featherweight division and even though he was unable to capture a belt with the promotion zabeed mughamet cheripov does not need it to prove how good he is that's why i would give his mma career an 8.5 out of 10. but what do you think how good was a beat mango met cherrypov actually and what was your favorite moment from his career but that's a lot for now so i'll see my next one","output":"The video is about Zabit Magomedsharipov, a mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter who recently retired at the age of 31.

Can you recommend a way to make my model better? Provide an example config","output":"It's difficult to provide a specific recommendation without more information about your model, the data it's being trained on, and the specific training and validation losses you're seeing. In general, if your training loss is significantly lower than your validation loss, it could be a sign of overfitting, which means that your model is performing well on the training data but is not able to generalize to new, unseen data.\n\nOne way to combat overfitting is to use regularization techniques, such as dropout or weight decay (L2 regularization). These techniques can help prevent the model from relying too heavily on any one feature, and can help improve its ability to generalize to new data.\n\nHere is an example configuration that uses dropout regularization:\n```\ninput_features:\n- name: image_path\n  type: image\n  encoder: \n      type: stacked_cnn\n      conv_layers:\n        - num_filters: 32\n          filter_size: 3\n          pool_size: 2\n          pool_stride: 2\n        - num_filters: 64\n          filter_size: 3\n          pool_size: 2\n          pool_stride: 2\n          dropout: 0.5  # <--- Add dropout to the convolutional layers\n      fc_layers:\n        - output_size: 128\n          dropout: 0.5  # <--- Add dropout to the fully-connected layers\noutput_features:\n - name: label\n   type: category\ntrainer:\n  epochs: 2\n  batch_size: 128\n```\nYou can experiment with different dropout rates (the `dropout` parameter in the config above) to see how it affects your model's performance. A good starting point is to use a dropout rate of 0.5, which means that each neuron has a 50% chance of being dropped during training. You can then adjust the dropout rate up or down as needed.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that the training and validation losses can sometimes diverge for other reasons, such as if your training set and validation set have different distributions. In this case, you may need to adjust your data preprocessing or data augmentation techniques to make the two sets more similar."}
{"instruction":"","input":"Can you explain in lay terms how a model like HEC-RAS interacts with DELFT-FEWS?","output":"HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System) is a computer program developed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers that is used to perform hydraulic and hydrologic analyses of rivers and streams. It is primarily used to predict the flow of water in rivers and streams, and to determine the impact of various factors such as changes in the terrain, flow rate, and water levels on the behavior of the river or stream.\n\nDELFT-FEWS (Integrated Data-Driven Flood Early Warning System) is a software system that is used to monitor and forecast flood events. It is designed to integrate data from a variety of sources, including weather forecasts, river flow measurements, and satellite imagery, and to use this data to predict the likelihood and severity of flood events.\n\nOne way in which HEC-RAS and DELFT-FEWS might interact is by using the output from HEC-RAS as input to DELFT-FEWS. For example, HEC-RAS might be used to simulate the flow of a river or stream under various conditions, and the results of these simulations could be used by DELFT-FEWS to predict the likelihood and severity of flooding in a given area. Alternatively, DELFT-FEWS might use its flood prediction capabilities to identify areas that are at risk of flooding, and HEC-RAS could be used to evaluate the potential impacts of these flood events on the surrounding terrain and infrastructure."}
{"instruction":"","input":"the solenoids will be 12v so they will have to be controled by relays triggered by the GPIO pins","output":"That's correct! To control 12V solenoids with the Raspberry Pi, you will need to use relay modules that are compatible with the Pi's GPIO pins.\n\nRelay modules allow you to use a low-voltage signal (in this case, from the Pi's GPIO pins) to control a high-voltage circuit (the 12V solenoids). The relay acts like a switch that is controlled by the Pi's GPIO pins. When the GPIO pin is set to HIGH, the relay is closed and the solenoid is turned on, and when the GPIO pin is set to LOW, the relay is opened and the solenoid is turned off.\n\nHere's an example of how to connect a relay module to the Raspberry Pi and control a solenoid:\n\n1. Connect the relay module to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. The exact wiring will depend on the specific relay module you are using, so be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions. In general, you will need to connect the relay module's VCC and GND pins to the Pi's 5V and GND pins, and connect the relay module's IN pin to a GPIO pin on the Pi.\n2. Connect the solenoid to the relay module. Again, the exact wiring will depend on the specific components you are using. Typically, you will connect one end of the solenoid to the relay module's NO (Normally Open) pin and the other end to the relay module's COM (Common) pin. When the relay is closed, the circuit is completed and the solenoid is turned on.\n3. Write a Python program that uses the RPi.GPIO library to control the GPIO pins and turn the solenoids on and off through the relay modules. The exact code will depend on your specific setup and timed sequence requirements, but here's an example of how to turn a single solenoid on and off:\n```python\nimport RPi.GPIO as GPIO\nimport time\n\n# Set up GPIO pins\nGPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)\nGPIO.setup(relay_pin, GPIO.OUT)\n\n# Turn solenoid on\nGPIO.output(relay_pin, GPIO.HIGH)\ntime.sleep(on_time)\n\n# Turn solenoid off\nGPIO.output(relay_pin, GPIO.LOW)\ntime.sleep(off_time)\n\n# Clean up GPIO pins\nGPIO.cleanup()\n```\n4. Modify the Python program to control multiple solenoids in a timed sequence. You can use the same basic logic as the example above, but you will need to add additional relay modules and GPIO pins for each solenoid.\n5. Add a feature to the GUI that allows you to set the time for each solenoid in the sequence.\n6. Test the entire system to ensure that the timed sequence and relay control are working correctly. Make sure to test the system under a variety of operating conditions to ensure reliability.\n\nWith these additional steps, you will have a control module that can control 12V solenoids using relay modules that are triggered by the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins."}

Toronto, Canada:\nToronto is a diverse city with a strong demand for student and intern housing due to its many universities and businesses. The cost of living is relatively high, but Canada has a stable legal system and a favorable environment for startups. Be prepared for competition in the housing market, and research local regulations related to rental properties.\n4. Barcelona, Spain:\nBarcelona is an attractive destination for international students and interns due to its pleasant climate, rich culture, and relatively low cost of living. The city has a strong demand for housing, but local regulations may be more challenging to navigate. Be prepared to invest time in understanding Spanish rental laws and business regulations.\n5. Sydney, Australia:\nSydney is a popular destination for students and interns, boasting several world-renowned universities and a thriving business scene.

They argue over their crimefighting methods, and fight each other.","output":"Batman, Punisher, and Deadpool were all patrolling the streets of Gotham City when they stumbled upon each other. Batman, being the traditionalist, was disgusted by the way Punisher and Deadpool went about their crimefighting.\n\n\"You two are nothing but vigilantes,\" Batman spat at them. \"You have no regard for the law or due process. You just go around killing people without any consequences.\"\n\nPunisher and Deadpool just laughed at Batman's statements. \"We're not like you, Batman,\" Punisher said with a smirk. \"We don't have the luxury of being able to afford a fancy suit and gadgets. We have to take care of things the best way we know how - by any means necessary.\"\n\n\"Yeah, and at least we have some fun while doing it,\" Deadpool added. \"You're always so serious and brooding. Lighten up, Batsy.\"\n\nBatman's anger boiled over and he charged at the two of them. Punisher and Deadpool were ready for him, and they all began to fight each other. Punisher used his guns and martial arts skills to take on Batman, while Deadpool used his weapons and regenerative abilities to take on both of them.\n\nThe fight raged on for what seemed like hours, with no clear winner in sight. The three of them were evenly matched, but their vastly different methods of fighting made it difficult for any of them to gain the upper hand.\n\nFinally, the police arrived and intervened, breaking up the fight. Batman, Punisher, and Deadpool were taken into custody and reprimanded for their actions. As they were being led away, they all looked at each other with a newfound respect for their respective methods of crimefighting.\n\nBut deep down, they all knew that their disagreement on how to handle criminals would never truly be resolved."}

{"instruction":"","input":"How did people manipulate photographs before computers?","output":"Before computers, people manipulated photographs using various techniques and tools. Some of these techniques included:\n\n1. Darkroom processing: Photographers would develop their own photographs in a darkroom, where they could control the chemical processing of the film to create a desired effect. They could also make prints from negatives and make adjustments to the exposure, contrast, and other characteristics of the print.\n2. Hand coloring: Photographers could also hand-color black and white photographs using watercolors, oil paints, or other coloring agents. This was a labor-intensive process that required a great deal of skill and attention to detail.\n3. Montage: Photographers could create montages by combining multiple photographs into a single image. This could be done by physically cutting and pasting prints together, or by using tools like double exposure or multiple printing to achieve the same effect.\n4. Retouching: Photographers could also retouch prints using various techniques, such as airbrushing or scratching away the emulsion on the print to remove or hide blemishes or other unwanted features.\n\nOverall, manipulating photographs before computers required a great deal of skill and artistic talent, as well as a good understanding of the techniques and tools available at the time."}
{"instruction":"","input":"So ably doesn't support for flutter web. But there seems to be a way by using the dart js package and use ably js which supports for js. Can you show me how you can use these two libraries together to allow ably to work with flutter web","output":"Certainly! To use the Ably Realtime service with Flutter Web, you can utilize the 'dart:js' package to interact with the Ably JavaScript SDK. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:\n\n1. Add the Ably JavaScript SDK to your `web\/index.html` file:\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <!-- Add other meta tags, title, etc. -->\n  <script src=\"https:\/\/cdn.ably.io\/lib\/ably.min-1.js\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script>\n<\/head>\n<body>\n  <script src=\"main.dart.js\" type=\"application\/javascript\" defer><\/script>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n```\n1. Create a new Dart file (e.g., `ably_web.dart`) for the Ably wrapper:\n```dart\nimport 'dart:js';\n\nclass AblyWeb {\n  final JsObject _ably;\n\n  AblyWeb(String apiKey) : _ably = JsObject(context['Ably']['Realtime'], [apiKey]);\n\n  RealtimeChannel channel(String name) {\n    return RealtimeChannel(_ably.callMethod('channels', []).callMethod('get', [name]));\n  }\n}\n\nclass RealtimeChannel {\n  final JsObject _channel;\n\n  RealtimeChannel(this._channel);\n\n  void subscribe(Function(dynamic) callback) {\n    _channel.callMethod('subscribe', [\n      (JsObject message) {\n        callback(message['data']);\n      }\n    ]);\n  }\n\n  void publish(String name, dynamic data) {\n    _channel.callMethod('publish', [name, data]);\n  }\n}\n```\n1. Use the `AblyWeb` class in your Flutter Web app:\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter\/material.dart';\nimport 'ably_web.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      home: Scaffold(\n        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Ably Flutter Web Example')),\n        body: Home(),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass Home extends StatefulWidget {\n  @override\n  _HomeState createState() => _HomeState();\n}\n\nclass _HomeState extends State<Home> {\n  final _ably = AblyWeb('YOUR_ABLY_API_KEY');\n  final _channelName = 'example';\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    final channel = _ably.channel(_channelName);\n    channel.subscribe((message) {\n      print('Received message: $message');\n    });\n\n    return Center(\n      child: RaisedButton(\n        onPressed: () {\n          channel.publish('greeting', 'Hello from Flutter Web!');\n        },\n        child: Text('Send message'),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\nMake sure to replace `'YOUR_ABLY_API_KEY'` with your own Ably API key. This example demonstrates how to create a simple Flutter Web app that sends and receives messages via Ably."}

After confirmation, please wait for the next chunk.\n=== SCRIPT CHUNK 2\/3 ===\nalese said she nearly vomited when a professor at the Sorbonne told her that Conrad was really on her side, as if she could not decide for herself who was on her side. Ujunwa began to jump up and down, babbling nonsense to mimic Conrad\u2019s Africans, feeling the sweet lightness of wine in her head. The Zimbabwean staggered and fell into the water fountain and climbed out spluttering, her dreadlocks wet, saying she had felt some fish wriggling around in there. The Kenyan said he would use that for his story\u2014 fish in the fancy resort fountain\u2014since he really had no idea what he was going to write about. The Senegalese said her story was really her story, about how she mourned her girlfriend and how her grieving had emboldened her to come out to her parents although they now treated her being a lesbian as a mild joke and continued to speak of the families of suitable young men. The black South African looked alarmed when he heard \u201clesbian.\u201d He got up and walked away. The Kenyan said the black South African reminded him of his father, who attended a Holy Spirit Revival church and didn\u2019t speak to people on the street because they were not saved. The Zimbabwean, Tanzanian, white South African, and Senegalese all spoke about their fathers. They looked at Ujunwa and she realized that she was the only one who had said nothing, and for a moment the wine no longer fogged her mind. She shrugged and mumbled that there was really little to say about her father. He was a normal person. \u201cIs he in your life?\u201d the Senegalese asked, with the soft tone that meant she assumed he was not, and for the first time her Francophone accent irritated Ujunwa. \u201cHe is in my life,\u201d Ujunwa said with a quiet force. \u201cHe was the one who bought me books when I was a child and the one who read my early poems and stories.\u201d She paused, and everyone was looking at her and she added, \u201cHe did something that surprised me. It hurt me, too, but mostly it surprised me.\u201d The Senegalese looked as if she wanted to ask more but changed her mind and said she wanted more wine. \u201cAre you writing about your father?\u201d the Kenyan asked and Ujunwa answered with an emphatic NO because she had never believed in fiction as therapy. The Tanzanian told her that all fiction was therapy, some sort of therapy, no matter what anybody said. That evening, Ujunwa tried to write, but her eyeballs were swimming and her head was aching and so she went to bed. After breakfast, she sat before the laptop and cradled a cup of tea. Chioma gets a call from Merchant Trust bank, one of the places her father contacted. He knows the chairman of the board. She is hopeful; all the bank people she knows drive nice secondhand Jettas and have nice flats in Gbagada. The deputy manager interviews her. He is dark and good-looking and his glasses have an elegant designer logo on the frames and, as he speaks to her, she desperately wishes he would notice her. He doesn\u2019t. He tells her that they would like to hire her to do marketing, which will mean going out and bringing in new accounts. She will be working with Yinka. If she can bring in ten million naira during her trial period, she will be guaranteed a permanent position. She nods as he speaks. She is used to men\u2019s attention and is sulky that he does not look at her as a man looks at a woman, and she does not quite understand what he means by going out to get new accounts until she starts the job two weeks later. A uniformed driver takes her and Yinka in an air-conditioned official Jeep\u2014she runs her hand over the smooth leather seat, is reluctant to climb out\u2014to the home of an alhaji in Ikoyi. The alhaji is avuncular and expansive with his smile, his hand gestures, his laughter. Yinka has already come to see him a few times before and he hugs her and says something that makes her laugh. He looks at Chioma. \u201cThis one is too fine,\u201d he says. A steward serves frosted glasses of chapman. The alhaji speaks to Yinka but looks often at Chioma. Then he asks Yinka to come closer and explain the high-interest savings accounts to him and then he asks her to sit on his lap and doesn\u2019t she think he\u2019s strong enough to carry her? Yinka says of course he is and sits on his lap, smiling a serene smile. Yinka is small and fair; she reminds Chioma of the Yellow Woman. What Chioma knows of the Yellow Woman is what her mother told her. One slow afternoon, the Yellow Woman had walked into her mother\u2019s boutique on Adeniran Ogunsanya Street. Her mother knew who the Yellow Woman was, knew the relationship with her husband had been on for a year, knew that he had paid for the Yellow Woman\u2019s Honda Accord and her flat in Ilupeju. But what drove her mother crazy was the insult of this: the Yellow Woman coming to her boutique, looking at shoes and planning to pay for them with money that really belonged to her husband. So her mother yanked at the Yellow Woman\u2019s weave-on that hung to her back and screamed \u201cHusband snatcher!\u201d and the salesgirls joined in, slapping and beating the Yellow Woman until she ran out to her car. When Chioma\u2019s father heard of it, he shouted at her mother and said she had acted like one of those wild women from the street, had disgraced him, herself, and an innocent woman for nothing. Then he left the house. Chioma came back from National Youth Service and noticed that her father\u2019s wardrobe was empty. Aunty Elohor, Aunty Rose, and Aunty Uche had all come and said to her mother, \u201cWe are prepared to go with you and beg him to come back home or we will go and beg on your behalf.\u201d Chioma\u2019s mother said, \u201cNever, not in this world. I am not going to beg him. It is enough.\u201d Aunty Funmi came and said the Yellow Woman had tied him up with medicine and she knew a good babalawo who could untie him. Chioma\u2019s mother said, \u201cNo, I am not going.\u201d Her boutique was failing, because Chioma\u2019s father had always helped her import shoes from Dubai. So she lowered prices, advertised in Joy and City People, and started stocking shoes made in Aba. Chioma is wearing a pair of those shoes the morning she sits in the alhaji\u2019s sitting room and watches Yinka, perched on the expansive lap, talking about the benefits of a savings account with Merchant Trust Bank. . . . At first, Ujunwa tried not to notice that Edward often stared at her body, that his eyes were never on her face but always lower. The workshop days had taken on a routine of breakfast at eight and lunch at one and dinner at six in the grand dining room. On the sixth day, a blisteringly hot day, Edward handed out copies of the first story to be reviewed, written by the Zimbabwean. The participants were all seated on the terrace, and after he handed out the papers, Ujunwa saw that all the seats under the umbrellas were occupied. \u201cI don\u2019t mind sitting in the sun,\u201d she said, already getting up. \u201cWould you like me to stand up for you, Edward?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d rather like you to lie down for me,\u201d he said. The moment was humid, thick; a bird cawed from far away. Edward was grinning. Only the Ugandan and the Tanzanian had heard him. Then the Ugandan laughed. And Ujunwa laughed, because it was funny and witty, she told herself, when you really thought about it. After lunch, she took a walk with the Zimbabwean and as they stopped to pick up shells by the sea, Ujunwa wanted to tell her what Edward had said. But the Zimbabwean seemed distracted, less chatty than usual; she was probably anxious about her story. Ujunwa read it that evening. She thought the writing had too many flourishes, but she liked the story and wrote appreciations and careful suggestions in the margins. It was familiar and funny, about a Harare secondary schoolteacher whose Pentecostal minister tells him that he and his wife will not have a child until they get a confession from the witches who have tied up his wife\u2019s womb. They become convinced that the witches are their next-door neighbors, and every morning they pray loudly, throwing verbal Holy Ghost bombs over the fence. After the Zimbabwean read an excerpt the next day, there was a short silence around the dining table. Then the Ugandan spoke and said there was much energy in the prose. The white South African nodded enthusiastically. The Kenyan disagreed. Some of the sentences tried so hard to be literary that they didn\u2019t make sense, he said, and he read one such sentence. The Tanzanian man said a story had to be looked at as a whole and not in parts. Yes, the Kenyan agreed, but each part had to make sense in order to form a whole that made sense. Then Edward spoke. The writing was certainly ambitious, but the story itself begged the question \u201cSo what?\u201d There was something terribly pass\u00e9 about it when one considered all the other things happening in Zimbabwe under the horrible Mugabe. Ujunwa stared at Edward. What did he mean by \u201cpass\u00e9\u201d? How could a story so true be pass\u00e9? But she did not ask what Edward meant and the Kenyan did not ask and the Ugandan did not ask and all the Zimbabwean did was shove her dreadlocks away from her face, cowries clinking. Everyone else remained silent. Soon they all began to yawn and say good night and walk to their cabins. The next day, they did not talk about the previous evening. They talked about how fluffy the scrambled eggs were and how eerie the jacaranda leaves that rustled against their windows at night were. After dinner, the Senegalese read from her story. It was a windy night and they shut the door to keep out the sound of the whirling trees. The smoke from Edward\u2019s pipe hung over the room. The Senegalese read two pages of a funeral scene, stopping often to sip some water, her accent thickening as she became more emotional, each t sounding like a z. Afterwards, everyone turned to Edward, even the Ugandan, who seemed to have forgotten that he was workshop leader. Edward chewed at his pipe thoughtfully before he said that homosexual stories of this sort weren\u2019t reflective of Africa, really. \u201cWhich Africa?\u201d Ujunwa blurted out. The black South African shifted on his seat. Edward chewed further at his pipe. Then he looked at Ujunwa in the way one would look at a child who refused to keep still in church and said that he wasn\u2019t speaking as an Oxford-trained Africanist, but as one who was keen on the real Africa and not the imposing of Western ideas on African venues. The Zimbabwean and Tanzanian and white South African began to shake their heads as Edward was speaking. \u201cThis may indeed be the year 2000, but how African is it for a person to tell her family that she is homosexual?\u201d Edward asked. The Senegalese burst out in incomprehensible French and then, a minute of fluid speech later, said, \u201cI am Senegalese! I am Senegalese!\u201d Edward responded in equally swift French and then said in English, with a soft smile, \u201cI think she had too much of that excellent Bordeaux,\u201d and some of the participants chuckled. Ujunwa was the first to leave. She was close to her cabin when she heard somebody call her and she stopped. It was the Kenyan. The Zimbabwean and the white South African were with him. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the bar,\u201d the Kenyan said. She wondered where the Senegalese was. In the bar, she drank a glass of wine and listened to them talk about how the other guests at Jumping Monkey Hill \u2014all of whom were white\u2014looked at the participants suspiciously. The Kenyan said a youngish couple had stopped and stepped back a little as he approached them on the path from the swimming pool the day before. The white South African said she got suspicious looks, too, perhaps because she wore only kente-print caftans. Sitting there, staring out into the black night, listening to the drink-softened voices around her, Ujunwa felt a self-loathing burst open in the bottom of her stomach. She should not have laughed when Edward said \u201cI\u2019d rather like you to lie down for me.\u201d It had not been funny. It had not been funny at all. She had hated it, hated the grin on his face and the glimpse of greenish teeth and the way he always looked at her chest rather than her face, the way his eyes climbed all over her, and yet she had made herself laugh like a deranged hyena. She put down her half-finished glass of wine and said, \u201cEdward is always looking at my body.\u201d The Kenyan and the white South African and Zimbabwean stared at her. Ujunwa repeated, \u201cEdward is always looking at my body.\u201d The Kenyan said it was clear from the first day that the man would be climbing on top of that flat stick of a wife and\n=== END OF CHUNK ===","output":"I confirm receipt of chunk 2\/3.

Unlike traditional computers, which use bits to store and process information, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This allows them to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers. Additionally, quantum computers can be used to solve certain problems that are intractable for classical computers. For example, they can be used to simulate the behavior of molecules and materials, which could have applications in fields such as chemistry and materials science."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Rewrite the below Statement of purpose to increase my odds of getting an admission in University of edinburgh.\nFrom a younger age I was captivated by the world of Science Fiction and its portrayal of artificial intelligence. Movies such as iRobot and Wall-E sparked my imagination and fuelled my curiosity about the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence and my passion and interest only grew stronger as I grew older. Rather than a fantasy I saw possibilities. However, it wasn\u2019t until a 20 day study camp at the MS Swaminathan research Foundation, a leading institution that researches in sustainable development and environmental stability, led by the Main architect of green revolution in India, Dr MS Swaminathan, I became acutely aware of the urgent need to address the environmental challenges facing the world today. I made the connection between AI and its potential applications for environmental sustainability. I resolved to combine my passion for AI with commitment to environmental sustainability to dedicate my life in a pursuit that ensures a better future for our planet. I have started thinking about various ways in which we can use AI to address environmental challenges such as pollution, climate change, destruction of ecosystems etc. For example robots that takes away plastic waste, or drones that can help monitor and manage ecosystems to identify early warning signs of degradation and\/or damage. (\\*)So it became my ambition to be an AI researcher in one of the world\u2019s best robotics and autonomous systems research facility that aligns with my goals.\nAs AI was a new and emerging field in India in 2010 with limited specialised bachelor\u2019s degree courses, so I pursued a computer science degree which I completed with a distinction. (I wanted to) (Despite wanting to further my education) (but didn\u2019t have the resources to do so at that time) Due to the lack of resources at that time I was not able to pursue a Master\u2019s in AI. Hence, I joined IBM where I had the opportunity to take up additional AI projects, honing my technical skills and gain real world experience in the field. I continued to learn as much as I could about reinforcement learning and my project EXA(Expert Advice) was chosen as one of the top 10 projects in IBM Cognitive Build contest associated with IBM Watson. My focus became clearer and more defined so I quit my job at IBM to fully concentrate on deep learning, as I was only doing AI partially. My shear perseverance, tenacity and months of hard work enabled be to land a job in Quinnox as full time AI engineer. I was able to ideate, create and deploy more than 30 deep learning models in production involving computer vision, NLP and Reinforcement learning during the past five years. I was also granted a patent in 2021 for one of the AI Algorithms I have developed (US11205041B2) which was a catalyst in believing my ability to create unique and innovative solutions. Eventhough I was promoted and well paid(as per Indian standards) \nMy objective became more refined and lucid when I was developing an autonomous agent, Rover, for my recent project. I realised multi agent and multi modal reinforcement learning interests me the most and would help me in achieving my dream of creating autonomous agents than can help in maintaining a sustainable planet. The dream became more of a goal now. Now I am at crossroads in my life and career. I look around and find that I have more resources and opportunities than I first started. So I feel like I owe it to myself and my younger self to pursue this next step that will take me closer to the goal. After my masters I would like to pursue a PhD to focus solely in field to be eligible to become the AI researcher in one of the top research centres for Robotics and Autonomous Systems.\nI have been following research and publications in multi agent and multimodal reinforcement learning and I came to know about the research by Dr. Stefano V Aldrich of University of Endiburgh and was intrigued by it as it aligns perfectly with what I wanted to do in AI. \nBeing a global leader in robotics and autonomous systems MSc in AI from the school of informatics, University of Edinburgh will be able to offer me the rich intellectual environment to become an expert in the field of AI with its state of the art facilities and will provide me with opportunities to get guidance from world class researchers. Also I will be able to connect and collaborate with like minded peers and researchers and may even be able to form life long friendships. University of Edinburgh School of Informatics with CISA, ANC and IPAB will provide me with opportunities for personal and professional growth that may not be available elsewhere. Also I would like to publish papers in peer reviewed Ai conferences such as NeurIPS, CVPR, ICML, ICLR, ICCV etc. \nI always keep a growth mindset and is a continuous learner. I have made several contributions to open source software and maintains a blog. I give back to the developer community with my skills in Python, Pytorch and tensorflow and my answers in stack overflow had reached more than 1.4 million people world wide. As an IEEE and ACM volunteer, I was able to host and participate I many events associated with the same. My contributions in my current organisation have taken ideas to fully fledged products used by dozens of clients. I am a Python and Pytorch verified expert as certified by Pluralsight, I also have experience in Android apps using flutter. I use reinforcement learning to automate games like Asphalt during my personal time.I have more than 8 years of hands on experience in developing AI solutions. For instance I have developed a multimodal Rl agent that can navigate through apps on its own taking visual and textual inputs.\nI have a unique combination of academic background, practical experience and perspective that I believe will make me a strong candidate for the MSc in AI program at University of Edinburgh. My undergraduate degree in computer science has given me string foundation in programming algorithms and data structures. \nMy passion and commitment to develop robots that can maintain environmental stability is something I believe sets me apart. I have a strong academic background in computer science with a bachelors degree from a leading institution. Over the past few years I have focused my attention on how Ai can be applied to tackle environmental challenges. \nMy passion for the environment has been lifelong and I believe that AI and robotics have the potential to be powerful tools in addressing some of the most pressing environmental issues we face today. I am particularly interested in the development of agents that can aid in tasks such a monitoring and cleaning pollution, mitigating the impact of climate change and preserving biodiversity.\nTo pursue my goals I have worked on a variety of projects related to AI and Environment. For example I developed a deep learning model that can detect plastic waste from aerial images with an accuracy above 85%. I have also explored the use of RL in developing algorithms for controlling autonomous vehicles that can help cleaning up pollution.\nIn the MSc in AI program, I hope to further develop my skills and knowledge in areas such as robotics, computer vision and reinforcement learning as well as explore new areas such as multi agent autonomous systems. \nI am excited to work with faculty and fellow students who share my passion for using AI to address environmental challenges and to develop innovative solutions that can have a positive impact on our planet. I believe My academic background, technical skills and passion for the environment makes me a unique candidate for MSc at University of Edinburgh\u2019s School of Informatics.","output":"Here is a possible rewrite of your statement of purpose to increase your odds of getting an admission in the University of Edinburgh:\n\nSince a young age, I have been captivated by the world of Science Fiction and its portrayal of artificial intelligence. Movies such as iRobot and Wall-E sparked my imagination and fueled my curiosity about the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence. Rather than just a fantasy, I saw possibilities. My passion and interest only grew stronger as I grew older, and it wasn't until a 20-day study camp at the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation, a leading institution that researches sustainable development and environmental stability, that I became acutely aware of the urgent need to address the environmental challenges facing the world today. This experience made me realize that I could combine my passion for AI with my commitment to environmental sustainability to dedicate my life to a pursuit that ensures a better future for our planet.\n\nI have been thinking about various ways in which we can use AI to address environmental challenges such as pollution, climate change, and destruction of ecosystems. For example, robots that can take away plastic waste, or drones that can help monitor and manage ecosystems to identify early warning signs of degradation and\/or damage. My ambition is to be an AI researcher in one of the world's best robotics and autonomous systems research facilities that aligns with my goals.\n\nAlthough AI was a new and emerging field in India in 2010 with limited specialized bachelor's degree courses, I pursued a computer science degree, which I completed with distinction. Due to the lack of resources at that time, I was not able to pursue a Master's in AI. Instead, I joined IBM, where I had the opportunity to take up additional AI projects, honing my technical skills and gaining real-world experience in the field. I continued to learn as much as I could about reinforcement learning, and my project EXA(Expert Advice) was chosen as one of the top 10 projects in the IBM Cognitive Build contest associated with IBM Watson.

{"instruction":"","input":"Project goals : mass adoption and network effect\ntarget audience: crypto, regenerative finance, sustainability, finance, carbon emission, investors\nspecific requirements: build the white paper under this format \n\nintroduction:\nEco is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that aims to tackle the global problem of carbon emissions through the creation and sale of carbon offsets. The goal of the organization is to plant trees and other vegetation that will absorb and store carbon from the atmosphere, offsetting the carbon emissions of individuals and businesses.\nProblem Statement:\nCarbon emissions are a major contributor to climate change, and reducing these emissions is essential for the health and wellbeing of the planet. However, many individuals and businesses are unable or unwilling to make the necessary changes to reduce their own carbon emissions. Carbon offsets provide a way for these individuals and businesses to offset their carbon emissions by supporting projects that remove carbon from the atmosphere, such as tree planting.\nSolution:\nEco offers a solution to the problem of carbon emissions through the creation and sale of carbon offsets. By planting trees and other vegetation, Eco will absorb and store carbon from the atmosphere, offsetting the carbon emissions of individuals and businesses.\nTechnology:\nEco will use blockchain technology to create a transparent and secure platform for the creation and sale of carbon offsets. In addition, Eco will use QR codes and drones to provide traceability and verification of the carbon offset projects, ensuring that the offsets are accurate and reliable.\nEcosystem:\nEco's ecosystem will include individuals and businesses that purchase carbon offsets, as well as the tree planting and carbon offset projects themselves. Eco will also partner with existing carbon offset projects to expand the reach and impact of the organization.\nMarket Analysis:\nThe market for carbon offsets is growing, with increasing demand from individuals and businesses looking to offset their carbon emissions. Eco aims to tap into this growing market and become a leading provider of carbon offsets.\nToken Economics:\nEco will issue its own token, the ECO token, which will be used to facilitate the creation and sale of carbon offsets. The ECO token will also be used to incentivize participation in the ecosystem, with rewards for individuals and businesses that contribute to the success of the organization.\nRoadmap:\nEco's roadmap includes the launch of the platform, the creation and sale of carbon offsets, and the expansion of the organization through partnerships and the addition of new projects.\nCarbon Certificate NFT:\nIn addition to the sale of carbon offsets, Eco will also offer the option to purchase carbon certificates in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These NFTs will represent a verified and verifiable record of the carbon offsets purchased.\nBiodiversity NFT Upsell:\nEco recognizes the importance of biodiversity and the role that trees and other vegetation play in supporting a healthy and diverse ecosystem. As such, Eco will offer the option to purchase biodiversity credits in the form of NFTs, which will represent the restoration and enhancement of local biodiversity through the planting of native trees and other vegetation.\nAdditionality:\nOne of the key benefits of Eco's carbon offset projects is the additionality that they provide. By planting new trees and other vegetation, Eco is not only offsetting existing carbon emissions, but also increasing the overall amount of carbon stored in the environment. This is an important factor in the fight against climate change and will be highlighted as a key selling point for Eco's carbon offsets.\nConclusion:\nEco is a promising solution to the problem of carbon emissions, offering a transparent and secure platform for the creation and sale of carbon offsets. By using blockchain technology, traceability and verification measures, and innovative NFT offerings, Eco is well positioned to become a leader in the carbon offset market.","output":"This is a solid outline for a white paper on Eco.

{"instruction":"","input":"how to verify which volumes are attached using powershell","output":"To verify which volumes are attached using PowerShell, you can use the `Get-Volume` cmdlet. This cmdlet will return a list of all the volumes currently attached to your system, along with information about each volume such as its drive letter, file system, capacity, and free space.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `Get-Volume` cmdlet to list all attached volumes:\n```\nPS C:\\> Get-Volume\n\nDriveLetter FileSystemLabel FileSystem DriveType HealthStatus SizeRemaining Size\n----------- --------------- ---------- --------- ------------ ------------- ----\nC                            NTFS       Fixed     Healthy      917.61 GB    931.51 GB\nD                            NTFS       Fixed     Healthy      479.26 GB    499.25 GB\n```\nIn this example, two volumes are attached to the system, and they are both NTFS-formatted fixed drives that are in healthy condition. The `C` drive has a capacity of 931.51 GB and 917.61 GB of free space remaining, while the `D` drive has a capacity of 499.25 GB and 479.26 GB of free space remaining.\n\nYou can also use the `-FileSystem` parameter to filter the results to only show volumes with a specific file system. For example, to only show volumes that are formatted with the NTFS file system, you can use the following command:\n```\nPS C:\\> Get-Volume -FileSystem NTFS\n\nDriveLetter FileSystemLabel FileSystem DriveType HealthStatus SizeRemaining Size\n----------- --------------- ---------- --------- ------------ ------------- ----\nC                            NTFS       Fixed     Healthy      917.61 GB    931.51 GB\nD                            NTFS       Fixed     Healthy      479.26 GB    499.25 GB\n```\nThis will return the same list of volumes as in the previous example, but it filters out any volumes that are not formatted with the NTFS file system.\n\nYou can also use the `-DriveType` parameter to filter the results to only show volumes with a specific drive type. For example, to only show volumes that are fixed drives, you can use the following command:\n```\nPS C:\\> Get-Volume -DriveType Fixed\n\nDriveLetter FileSystemLabel FileSystem DriveType HealthStatus SizeRemaining Size\n----------- --------------- ---------- --------- ------------ ------------- ----\nC                            NTFS       Fixed     Healthy      917.61 GB    931.51 GB\nD                            NTFS       Fixed     Healthy      479.26 GB    499.25 GB\n```\nThis will return the same list of volumes as in the previous examples, but it filters out any volumes that are not fixed drives.\n\nYou can combine the `-FileSystem` and `-DriveType` parameters to filter the results even further. For example, to only show volumes that are formatted with the NTFS file system and are fixed drives, you can use the following command:\n```\nPS C:\\> Get-Volume -FileSystem NTFS -DriveType Fixed\n\nDriveLetter FileSystemLabel FileSystem DriveType HealthStatus SizeRemaining Size\n----------- --------------- ---------- --------- ------------ ------------- ----\nC                            NTFS       Fixed     Healthy      917.61 GB    931.51 GB\nD                            NTFS       Fixed     Healthy      479.26 GB    499.25 GB\n```\nThis will return the same list of volumes as in"}

{"instruction":"","input":"For student attendance, how could QR codes be used to confirm attendance?","output":"QR codes can be a useful tool for confirming student attendance in a variety of settings, such as classrooms, events, and meetings. Here's how it could work:\n\n1. Generate unique QR codes for each student: Using a QR code generator, the teacher or administrator can create a unique code for each student, containing their name, ID number, or any other relevant information.\n2. Distribute the QR codes: The QR codes can be distributed to the students either via email or printed copies. Students can save the QR code on their smartphones or print it out and bring it to class.\n3. Scan the QR code: The teacher or administrator can use a QR code scanner app on their smartphone or tablet to scan the students' QR codes as they arrive. This will confirm that the student is present in class and automatically record their attendance.\n4. Keep attendance records: The scanned QR codes can be automatically uploaded to an attendance record system, making it easy to keep track of who was present and who was absent. The teacher can then use this information to monitor attendance and follow up with students who miss class.\n\nUsing QR codes for student attendance offers several advantages. It's quick, easy, and efficient, reducing the time and effort required to take attendance manually. It also eliminates the possibility of errors in recording attendance and provides a more accurate and reliable record of attendance."}
{"instruction":"","input":"I am giving a speech on the philosophy of email and the impact it has on whale fishing. Please write a speech for me.","output":"Good morning everyone,\n\nToday, I want to talk to you about the philosophy of email and how it has impacted the world of whale fishing.\n\nAt its core, email is a simple concept. It's a way to send messages electronically, allowing us to communicate with people who are far away or even on the other side of the world. But despite its simplicity, email has had a profound impact on the way we live and work.\n\nOne of the most significant ways in which email has impacted the world is by making communication faster and more efficient. In the past, sending a letter or a message could take days, or even weeks, to reach its destination. But with email, we can send a message and have it delivered almost instantly.\n\nThis has been particularly beneficial for the world of whale fishing. In the past, whale fishermen would have to rely on slow and unreliable methods of communication, such as sending messages by boat or by carrier pigeon. This made it difficult for them to coordinate their efforts and respond to changes in the market.\n\nBut with email, whale fishermen can now communicate quickly and easily. They can share information about the location of schools of whales, or alert each other to changes in fishing regulations. This has made their work more efficient and has helped them to catch more whales.\n\nOf course, email has also had its critics. Some people argue that it has led to a decrease in face-to-face communication, and that it has made us more isolated and less connected to the people around us. And there is certainly some truth to this.\n\nBut overall, I believe that the benefits of email far outweigh the drawbacks. It has made the world a smaller and more connected place, and it has had a profound impact on industries like whale fishing.\n\nSo the next time you send an email, remember the powerful impact that this simple technology has had on our world. Thank you."}

The objective is to visualize the image with different amounts of noise using the imagesc() and mesh() functions.\n\nTo begin with, the researcher loaded the image 'len\\_gray.jpg' using the imread() function and displayed it using the imshow() function. This allowed them to view the original image before applying the noise.\n\nNext, the researcher added salt and pepper noise to the image using the imnoise() function. The function takes three arguments - the input image, the type of noise, and the noise density. The 'salt & pepper' type of noise was chosen, which adds random black and white pixels to the image. The noise density was varied from 0.1 to 0.8 to create different levels of noise.\n\nAfter adding the noise, the researcher used the imagesc() and mesh() functions to visualize the images. The imagesc() function is used to display the image as a 2D plot, where each pixel value is represented by a color. The mesh() function, on the other hand, creates a 3D plot of the image, where the height of the plot represents the pixel values.\n\nTo display all the images together, the researcher used the subplot() function to create a grid of plots. Each image was displayed in a separate subplot, allowing for easy comparison between the original image and the noisy images.\n\nIn conclusion, the researcher successfully loaded the image 'len\\_gray.jpg' and added salt and pepper noise to it for different amounts of noise density. The images were then visualized using the imagesc() and mesh() functions, which allowed for easy comparison between the original image and the noisy images. Overall, this approach is useful for analyzing the effects of noise on image quality and can be applied to various image processing tasks."}
{"instruction":"","input":"describe thought in the absence of language. how is thought without language","output":"The nature of thought in the absence of language is a topic of ongoing debate among psychologists, linguists, and philosophers. While it is difficult to definitively describe thought without language, there are a few different theories and perspectives to consider.\n\nOne view suggests that language is necessary for thought to exist at all, and that the two are inherently intertwined. According to this perspective, our ability to think abstractly, reason logically, and solve problems depends on our ability to use language to symbolize concepts and ideas. In other words, without language, we would be limited to thinking in concrete, sensory-based terms.\n\nHowever, other researchers argue that thought can exist without language, and that we can form mental images and manipulate them without necessarily needing words. For example, visual and spatial reasoning tasks, such as mentally rotating objects, do not necessarily require language.\n\nAnother perspective suggests that while we may be able to think without language, language plays a crucial role in shaping and influencing our thought processes. According to this view, the words and concepts we use to describe the world around us can influence the way we perceive and interpret that world, and can even impact the types of thoughts we are able to have.\n\nUltimately, the relationship between language and thought is complex and multifaceted, and our understanding of it is still evolving. While it is clear that language plays an important role in shaping our thoughts and perceptions, it is also likely that some forms of thought can exist independently of language."}

meet in real life for along time Christy Shaw the CEO of kitePharma great to meet you great to meetyou in person Brad so before we getstarted I have to say I've never seen aday that's gone from pouring rain to Sunto pouring rain to Sun as many times asit has today I don't know if this isnormal but it's nice now the weather ishowling but we wanted to take advantageof the break in the clouds to do this so\n\nyou're the CEO of kite Firma we had youon clubhouse a handful of months ago itwas one of the most memorable ones thatwe did thank you yeah one of the thingsI remember you saying is that you caredfor a sister who sadly passed ofmultiple myelomaand I remember asking you during thatClubhouse do you have a bcma program andthen back then you did not but you justsigned a big deal and now you have onethat must feel good personally tell us\n\nabout that yes it is you know my sisterSherry was in a phase 1A clinical trialwith bcma and unfortunately for her itdidn't work and so fast forward that wasin 2016 six years later I wasn't even atkite at the time and now here we arewith the potentially Best in Classddbcma in partnership with our selectsthe deal hasn't closed yet but we'reextremely excited to bring this to theworld because like you asked me thequestion all of our customers are askingus too of what can kite do to help\n\nensure that more patients get celltherapy and multiple myeloma right sothis was this past year 2022 I I thinkwas a landmark year for cell therapy andone of the most important news itemsthat made it to be that was that it youwere in uh for your cd19 product for alarge b-cell lymphoma you're nowapproved in the second line setting andI think that's very important becausethe naysayers first of all said that\n\ncell therapy is never going to work andonce it worked they said well it willalways be for very late stage you knowhighly refractory patients and nowyou've proved that wrong as well can youtalk a little bit about that absolutelyyou know if you think of the patient onthat journey to potentially have aone-time treatment where you have youknowclose to a 50 chance of surviving therest of your life with no need forfurther therapies is really an ideal\n\nsituation so I think from a patientperspective first is where it all startsand the reason the second line approvalwas so significant is because it was thefirst time we had a phase threehead-to-head versus standard of care soit was a true robust trial that wasconfirmatory that said this is the newstandard of care it changed nccnguidelines and I think that's reallyhelped people start to really lookharder at whether their patients areeligible for cell therapy right so\n\nyou've been busy with businessdevelopment we just mentioned bcmathat's our celex and most recently youdid a deal you acquired team unity Iknow Bruce Levine and some of the UPennguys very well that worked on that itsounds like you're inheriting them as aconsultant or something why was itimportant for you to buy team unity wellit's interesting this isn't why we didthe deal but you talked about my mysister my sister was actually treated atUPenn by this team and so it's also verypersonally rewarding for me as well to\n\nbe back with the innovators in CellTherapy the Legacy innovators to be ableto partner together so the acquisitionof T immunity actually comes with it theresearch agreement with you Penn whichthen also called Jim Ann and Bruce areall actually going to be our scientificadvisors not just for team unity but forall of kite's pipeline so we're soexcited to part with them and we thinkwe'll be able together to reallyinnovate and and bring new things toMarket at scale Cell Therapy has beenaround long enough that now we can say\n\nthat's like old school Cell Therapythose those all of that team so it'scool that you're bringing them into thefold all right so one thing I'm talkinga lot with a lot of people this weekabout is the aloe versus autologousdebate I'm actually getting a littletired of talking about it um but I amI've become an aloe skeptic we allunderstand the utility of it you know ifit works like everyone understands thepromise of aloe but so far in the data\n\nthat I've seenyou know there's just very quickrelapses it just feels like it's notready for prime time yet and I feel likethe biggest beneficiary of that I meanwe all want it to get there for patientsbut from a corporate standpoint I thinkthat theproducts that are on the market todayare going to have more staying powerthan probably we thought a couple ofyears ago I'm sure you agree with thatbut how do you feel you know we do whenI when I first came here almost four\n\nyears ago it was you know aloe was goingto disrupt the entire autologous celltheory Marketbut we were pretty convicted based onthe results that we saw and we doubleddown focus and said we're going all inon autologous so we have three T-cellresearch Labs that commercialize thisproduct and do we hope aloe comes out itdoes sound great but I think there's alot of work to do and now withautologous coming faster to patients wenow manufacture in seven days ourturnaround time is 16 days fastest in\n\nthe industry you still have to do HLAtesting patients are still hospitalizedif you use aloe so we're trying to go asfast as we can with autologous to makeit as short as possible to get topatients while still keeping our optionsopen and trying to be the best partnerof choice if aloe actually comes tofruition and placing some of our own ownbets there but really our focus is onautologous Cell Therapy yeah and I justrecorded a video with Artie Aribeldegrine and I asked him this questionand I think where the consensus of the\n\nindustry is going is that aloe we allhope and believe that it will work oneday but it don't think of it as areplacement for autologous it may havespecific uses you know for specificpatientsum and that would be a win-win-win yeahI agree totally I think there's a placeunfortunately not all patients are curedof all the time and so I think there'san Avenue for lots of different types ofproducts all right lastly another topicthat is coming up a lot this week is\n\ntcrs there was a TCR engager that wasapproved earlier this year a TCR CellTherapy company just filed their firstblayou're a carteeum company have you looked at the TCRspace is that something that interestsyou you know it definitely is ofInterest I think we tend to wait forclinical data see the assets de-risk andthen go all in so right now we're kindof looking at

The code opens a recordset for the \"TEST\" table.\n2. It creates an instance of the MSXML2.DOMDocument60 object to create the XML document.\n3. It creates the CalypsoUploadDocument and CalypsoTrade elements using the createElement method of the DOMDocument60 object.\n4. It loops through the records in the recordset and creates the A, B, and C elements for each record.\n5. It appends the A, B, and C elements to the CalypsoTrade element using the appendChild method.\n6. It appends the CalypsoTrade element to the CalypsoUploadDocument element using the appendChild method.\n7. It appends the CalypsoUploadDocument element to the XML document using the appendChild method.\n8. It saves the XML document to a file using the Save method of the DOMDocument60 object.\n\nMake sure you set the correct file path in the xmlFilePath variable before running the code."}

{"instruction":"","input":"How should I implement a linked list in Rust? Keep in mind, this is for an embedded project so it's `no\\_std` and no heap allocation","output":"To implement a linked list in Rust without using the standard library, you can use a combination of enums and references to create a data structure that stores a sequence of values. Here's an example of how you might implement a singly-linked list:\n```\n\/\/ A node in the linked list.\nstruct Node<T> {\n    \/\/ The value stored in the node.\n    value: T,\n\n    \/\/ The next node in the list, or `None` if this is the last node.\n    next: Option<&Node<T>>,\n}\n\n\/\/ The linked list itself.\nstruct List<T> {\n    \/\/ The first node in the list, or `None` if the list is empty.\n    head: Option<&Node<T>>,\n}\n\nimpl<T> List<T> {\n    \/\/ Creates a new, empty linked list.\n    fn new() -> Self {\n        List { head: None }\n    }\n\n    \/\/ Adds a new value to the front of the list.\n    fn push(&mut self, value: T) {\n        let node = Node {\n            value: value,\n            next: self.head,\n        };\n        self.head = Some(&node);\n    }\n\n    \/\/ Removes the first value from the list and returns it, or `None` if the list is empty.\n    fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<T> {\n        match self.head {\n            Some(node) => {\n                self.head = node.next;\n                Some(node.value)\n            }\n            None => None,\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis implementation uses references (`&`) to link the nodes together, which means that you'll need to be careful to ensure that the nodes are not dropped before the list is finished with them. This can be done by making the list struct own its nodes, using `Box` or `Rc` to manage the memory, or using a \"smart pointer\" like `RefCell` or `Arc`."}

{"instruction":"","input":"how asynchronous programing works in c#?","output":"Asynchronous programming in C# allows for non-blocking operations to be executed, which can improve the responsiveness and performance of applications that perform I\/O-bound or compute-bound tasks.\n\nHere are the basic steps to create an asynchronous operation in C#:\n\n1. Define an asynchronous method using the async modifier. This method should return a Task, Task<T>, or void.\n2. Within the method, use the await keyword to indicate points at which the method can yield control to the calling thread while it waits for an asynchronous operation to complete.\n3. Use the Task.Run method to create a new task that runs the long-running operation on a separate thread.\n4. Optionally, you can use cancellation tokens to cancel the operation if it takes too long or is no longer needed.\n\nHere is an example of an asynchronous method that downloads data from a web service:\n```csharp\nasync Task<string> DownloadDataAsync(string url)\n{\n    using (var client = new WebClient())\n    {\n        var data = await client.DownloadStringTaskAsync(url);\n        return data;\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the method is marked as async and returns a Task<string> object. Within the method, the WebClient.DownloadStringTaskAsync method is called asynchronously using the await keyword. This method downloads the data from the specified URL asynchronously and returns the result as a string.\n\nTo call this method from another method, you can use the await keyword as well:\n```csharp\nvar data = await DownloadDataAsync(\"https:\/\/example.com\");\n```\nWhen this line of code is executed, the calling thread will yield control to the system until the DownloadDataAsync method completes. Once the method is complete, the result will be returned to the calling thread.\n\nOverall, asynchronous programming in C# can help improve the performance and responsiveness of applications by allowing them to execute non-blocking operations."}

He and his friends would joke around about their bodies, but Bobby's obsession with his testicles stood out. After graduating, they all went their separate ways, but when Bobby found himself at a crossroads in his life, he turned to music.\n\nThe group reunited at Eric and Paul's house, where they jammed and recorded their wild new song. Bobby and Kimandy's vocal harmonies brought the lyrics to life, with Gabe's triangle adding a subtle, cheeky undertone. Eric's cello added a somber touch to the ballad, while Paul's skin flute gave the track a more sensual edge. Loren's jar of nickles provided the perfect percussion.\n\nThe song took off like wildfire, with fans all over the world singing along to the catchy chorus. Bobby became an overnight sensation, and \"Bobby's Balls\" were on everyone's lips. But success came with a price, and soon the group's personal demons began to surface.\n\nBobby struggled with addiction, while Kimandy dealt with the pressure of being in the spotlight. Gabe felt like he was being pushed to the side, and Paul's skin flute playing was no longer enough to satisfy him. Eric became obsessed with the music videos, spending countless hours in the editing room. Loren found himself questioning the morality of the whole enterprise.\n\nIn the end, \"Bobby's Balls\" was too much for the world to handle. The controversy surrounding the song was too great, and the band was eventually forced to disband. But their legacy lives on, and the song remains a cult classic to this day. In this episode of \"Behind the Music,\" we'll explore the highs and lows of Bobby and his friends, and the lasting impact of their provocative music."}
{"instruction":"","input":"Below is some additional information about my ideal reader, Jen. Can you think of some more topics using this new information?\n\nTypical day: Gets up early, takes care of the pets, prepares coffee & breakfast, eats breakfast with the kids and cleans up, gets herself & her kids dressed, drops the kids off at school & daycare, drives 30 minutes to work, works all day, drives 30 minutes back, picks up the kids, takes care of the pets, makes dinner, eats dinner and cleans up, gets the kids ready for bathtime\/bed, reads a bedtime story, takes a shower, has a glass of wine, goes online or watches a bit of Netflix with her husband or calls her mother or does other things she needs to get done, and goes to bed. There are also some days when she has a similar routine but works at her home office.\n\nFood\/Exercise: Tries to go to the gym 2 times a week, as long as her husband is around to mind the kids. She\u2019s interested in healthy choices and organic food. She reads food labels and takes supplements. She tries to limit the amount of junk food that her kids get and encourages them to eat healthy foods. She has taken yoga classes in the past. She does meal delivery services (Green Chef) a few times a month to save time while cooking for the family. The family eats out or orders take-out several times a month. Her husband sometimes treats the kids to fast food (especially when she isn\u2019t around), which she isn\u2019t crazy about. \n\nChallenges: Her biggest challenge is time management and self-care. Being a busy mom who works full time, she tries to spend as much time as she can with her family, but that leaves her with very little time for herself. She frequently suffers from burnout. She gets frustrated and is hard on herself when she loses patience with her kids or husband, but sometimes she\u2019s just exhausted. She feels guilty when she does take time for herself. She used to have more hobbies and loved to be silly with her friends. She misses having those outlets. \n\nViews on Education: Places high value on education and loves to teach her kids new things. Her kids attend public schools, which are rated well in her community. She and her husband are actively saving for their college funds. She doesn't want her kids to be saddled with debt after they graduate, as she has been.\n\nEntertainment: Since she doesn\u2019t have a lot of free time, her preferred format for entertainment is audio. She frequently listens to audio content while doing other tasks, such as commuting to work or doing household chores. She enjoys content that feels like an escape from her busy life. She likes stories that make her laugh, pull her into another world, or get her thinking. She listens to podcasts on all kinds of topics (self-help, parenting, politics, news, true-crime, comedy, etc.), books from audible (fiction, historical fiction, thriller, self-help), and streams movies and TV (drama, thriller, comedy) from services like Netflix or Hulu. She enjoys historical fiction books, and true crime podcasts that have a whodunit mystery to solve, though she doesn\u2019t like anything with a lot of violence. She likes period dramas such as Mad Men and Downton Abby. After her kids go to bed, she will sometimes watch a Netflix series or old TV shows, often funny sitcoms (Big Band Theory), including some from her younger days (The Office, Friends), as a way to relax. She also enjoys doing puzzles...jigsaw puzzles, word puzzles, solving mysteries, etc. She loves to use her brain for creative problem-solving, a trait that she'd love to cultivate in her children.\n\nEntertainment for Kids: She is careful about letting her kids have too much passive entertainment and limits their time on the iPad. Some of her friends are getting smartphones for their young kids (age 7 or 8), but she thinks this is a bad idea. She worries that kids of today will miss out on the joy of using their imaginations, as she so frequently did as a child. She likes to read to her kids and encourages them to engage in creative play. She is drawn to educational products and toys. \n\nSocial Media: She has many social media accounts but is most active on Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest, Facebook, & YouTube.","output":"With this additional information, some potential topics that might interest Jen might include:\n\n* Strategies for balancing work and family responsibilities while maintaining a healthy work-life balance\n* Tips for time management and self-care for busy working parents\n* How to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle while balancing work and family responsibilities\n* How to make the most of meal delivery services and meal planning\n* How to raise children with a love of learning and a strong value on education\n* How to make the most of audio entertainment for busy parents\n* How to use puzzle-solving and problem-solving to relax and improve cognitive function\n* How to foster imagination and creativity in children through play and reading\n* How to use social media and technology in a way that is healthy and beneficial for families\n* How to manage the guilt of taking time for oneself as a busy parent\n* How to make the most of free time and engage in hobbies and activities that enrich one's life\n* How to navigate the challenges of public education and saving for college funds."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Explain quantum computing in simple terms","output":"Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process information.\n\nIn traditional computing, data is represented in bits that can have a value of either 0 or 1. However, in quantum computing, data is represented by quantum bits, or qubits, which can be in multiple states at once. This property, known as superposition, allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than traditional computers.\n\nAdditionally, quantum computers can use a phenomenon called entanglement, where two qubits can be linked in such a way that their states become interdependent. This property can be leveraged to perform operations that would be extremely difficult or impossible for traditional computers.\n\nOverall, quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize many areas of computing, including cryptography, optimization, and machine learning. However, quantum computers are still in the early stages of development and are currently limited in terms of their size and complexity."}

Install the required dependencies for Vue.js server-side rendering, such as `vue`, `vue-server-renderer`, and `vue-router`.\n2. Create a new Vue.js app using the Vue CLI or manually.\n3. Create a new Express.js route that will render the Vue.js app on the server-side. You can use a middleware like `vue-server-renderer` to render the Vue.js app on the server-side and send the HTML to the client.\n4. Update your existing Pug templates to include the Vue.js app. You can use Pug's `script` tag to include the JavaScript files for the Vue.js app.\n5. Configure Vue.js to perform client-side rendering (CSR) on the same URL path as the server-side rendering (SSR) route. You can use Vue.js' `createRouter` and `createApp` functions to create a Vue.js app that will handle client-side rendering.\n6. Use Vue.js' `hydrate` function to mount the app on the client-side and synchronize it with the server-side rendered HTML.\n7. Use Vue.js' `asyncData` function to fetch data from your internal API endpoint and pass it to the Vue.js app before rendering it on the server-side.\n\nOverall, this approach allows you to use both Vue.js and Pug in the same Node.js\/Express.js app, while also sharing the same port (port 80) with your existing API endpoints."}

However, there are many other factors that can influence MVP voting, such as the performance of other players and the narrative around the season. Ultimately, whether or not a player wins MVP is largely determined by the voters, and it's impossible to accurately predict the outcome of the voting process."}

{"instruction":"","input":"CHAPTER FIFTEEN\n RULE #6\n Crawl Before You Walk, Walk Before You Run\n From Jeremy\nAs you know by now, the essence of the protocol is lifelong behavioral change. That means changing the way you carry yourself and move (the neutral spine and all that). But it also means adopting and staying with our carefully designed (and progressive) exercise regimen. It is designed for back pain and it is essential for a permanent cure. And you have to do it correctly. There is an awful lot of text and a bunch of pictures about exercise in this book. But it\u2019s not because you have to do so many exercises; there really aren\u2019t that many. It\u2019s because we want you to do them right. Remember, you are far more likely to do these exercises with the compensatory patterns you have been doing for years unless you read closely and concentrate on doing them the right way. Doing them the wrong way will just make you better at doing bad things. \nOne great key to doing them right is to go slow in the learning process. Whether you\u2019re the type or not, you have to take it step-by-step. This is a healing process, and you cannot rush a healing process; it has its own rhythm and you have to follow it. Roll out these exercises slowly over time, progressing from one level to the next only when you \u201cget\u201d the level you are on and are ready to move up. \nRemember, it is these daily exercises that\u2014more than anything else\u2014are going to give most of you a significant and permanent reduction in pain and tightness. Other steps get you past the immediate pain. These steps make the change permanent. \nBe Still to Heal; Be Still to Stay Well \nOne of the main goals of changing your movement patterns is to make the \u201cbe still to heal\u201d concept (Rule #2, in Chapter 7) part of your daily life. Once you have achieved an initial fix, you don\u2019t have to be as still. But it is a great idea to learn to move with relative stillness (without moving your lumbar spine too much) all the time. \nThis is a big change for most of you, and you have to take it in steps; as I say, you have to crawl before you walk. The first step in learning to keep your lumbar spine still routinely is simply to learn to march in place, with a neutral spine. (This is the \u201ccrawl\u201d part of the process; it may seem too easy to bother with. It is not.) The goal is to learn to march in place with no lower spine movement. Then you can move on to other movements in this chapter.\nKey tip: If any of these movements hurt, take a step back to the last thing you could do without pain (marching in place, for instance). Stay with that for a few more days and then try to progress again. In theory, if you can march in place without pain, you can walk without pain and move without pain. It\u2019s just a matter of building up your core, turning on the right muscles, and learning to use those muscles to move in the right way. Whenever you have difficulty, go back to the previous step and start again. \nOkay, you\u2019ve done marching in place without moving your lower spine. Once that feels relatively simple, try doing this while walking. Things become a little murkier here because there are many factors at play. Because you are now weight-bearing, you need the support of important muscle groups like the glutes and latissimus dorsi (lats) to support your spine, in addition to the muscles we talked about in the core. If you can\u2019t do this at first without pain, follow the advice in the book for a while, and it will come once you have developed enough strength to support your spine while standing. \nWalking with Neutral Spine \nLearning to walk with a neutral spine means applying the same mechanics of your Slow March with Neutral Spine exercise to an upright, weight-bearing position. Almost everyone can improve their ability to walk without pain if they can do the slow march exercise on the ground. The distance you can walk without pain, or without significant increases in pain, will increase as you build core and gluteal strength and endurance by doing the exercises in this book. To get started on increasing your ability to walk with decreased pain, follow these directions:\nStep 1: Stand with good posture. Stand tall, shoulders back, head over your shoulders. Think of sticking your chest out and pulling your shoulder blades down and back. Make sure you aren\u2019t leaning forward. Tilt your pelvis back and forth (just like you did on the floor earlier), and stop where your lower back feels the most comfortable. \nStep 2: Use your core to lock your neutral spine in place. \nStep 3: Now try to walk while maintaining the position of your lower back and with the good posture you just set. It can help to put one hand on your stomach and one on your low back to feel for movement. Once you feel like you\u2019ve mastered maintaining neutral spine while walking, start to swing your arms from the shoulders, arm to opposite leg. This means if your right leg is swinging forward, your left arm should be as well. Make sure to always swing your arms from the shoulders as you walk; this helps dissipate force away from the spine. This movement takes time to master so don\u2019t get frustrated. Keep practicing. It gets easier after you have built endurance and strength in the muscles that support the spine. \nStep 4: If you sense your back is about to hurt, stop and have a seat for a few minutes and give your back a break. Then try walking a little longer. Over time, the period between these sitting breaks should increase, allowing you to walk farther without pain.\nNow let\u2019s move on to more complex movements. To make it easier (and to improve your chances of success) we are going to break those more complex movements down into pieces and then put them all together at the end. We will start with movement from the hips, a very basic move in all our lives all the time. Let\u2019s start with hip-hinging. Hip-hinging is a way to bend forward without stressing (i.e., bending) the spine. Done right, the axis of movement is in the hips, not the low back. Your low back should be in a protected neutral position with the core engaged. As you bend forward, your low back doesn\u2019t round or move. Let\u2019s look at a picture of hip-hinging and a picture of lumbar flexion (low back bending); one is good, the other is bad. This is simple stuff, but it is very hard to get over your ancient, bad habits. Hard but essential. \n\nHip-Hinge with Neutral Spine\nHere are a couple of pictures showing you the right way to hinge (on the left) and the wrong way (on the right). Notice the very slightly curved lower back in the hip-hinge picture on the left: no movement. Excellent! The pic on the right has quite a lot of spine movement; don\u2019t do that. When you first try this movement, it may feel awkward, and you may assume that you cannot reach as far forward with good posture. Not so. You\u2019ll soon realize that you can move just as far forward, using only your hips, as you did before, using your back. You don\u2019t lose anything and you avoid a ton of pain. Over time you will gain mobility. The reason is that moving with your lower back eventually causes pain and stiffness in your back. But moving from your hips will not have that result. Let\u2019s practice doing it right. \nRight Wrong\n\nStep 1: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.\nStep 2: Set your posture: Find neutral spine, brace the core, shoulders back, stand as tall as you can without pain and without breaking neutral spine. \nStep 3: Bend your knees slightly. \nStep 4: Feel the two bones sticking out of the sides of your hips. These are called your greater trochanters. Picture a pole going through these two points, passing right through your pelvis. This is your imaginary axis of movement.\nStep 5: Now place one hand on your stomach and the other on your back. On your back, put your fingers on those little bones sticking out (spinous processes). You are putting your hands here to feel for any unwanted movement when you hip-hinge. \nStep 6: Without moving anything in the core (you shouldn\u2019t feel those little bones in your back moving), slowly bend forward on that imaginary axis of movement through the hip bones while sticking your buttocks out behind you a little bit. If you feel your stomach or back move, stop, reset, and try again.\n\nStep 7: Go only as far forward as you can without moving your back. For many of you, your hamstrings (back of legs) are going to be a limiting factor in your range of motion in the beginning. Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t go too far. Your hamstrings will loosen up in time if you follow all of the advice in this book. \nStep 8: Slowly return to the starting position without moving your back or stomach. \nStep 9: This should not hurt your low back. If it does, reset your stance, find neutral spine, brace your core. Not hurting? Now try it again with a very small range of motion. Stay within the range of motion that doesn\u2019t hurt. Slowly increase your range of motion over time\u2014it will come. \nAdding Rotation\nNow let\u2019s get a little more complex. Let\u2019s add rotation to the bend. Hip-hinging correctly allows you to move forward and backward without pain. Now let\u2019s learn to move side to side. We are talking rotation. Again, think about moving from the hips. It\u2019s easiest to visualize proper rotation if you think about your waist. We don\u2019t want any movement at the waist. Try to picture your rib cage being locked on to your pelvis. That\u2019s what you want. Pretend that there are no joints between your ribs and pelvis, for this one. \nFull-Body Rotation\nThe chest, navel, and hips all move together. This means there is no (or very little) movement in the spine. The body rotates by moving the hips, knees, and pelvis. If the hips and pelvis stay facing forward while the rib cage moves, the movement comes from the waist, and therefore the lumbar spine. This type of movement can wear down the discs and joints in the spine over time, especially when additional load is applied (like unloading the dishwasher for instance). Just like hip-hinging, rotation done properly doesn\u2019t cause you to lose mobility and will improve athletic performance. Let\u2019s give it a try. Once again, the new movement is not that hard. But you are trying to unlearn a lifetime of moving with your spine. That is hard. \n\nStep 1: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\nStep 2: Set your posture: Find neutral spine, brace the core, shoulders back, stand as tall as you can without pain and without breaking neutral spine. \nStep 3: Bend your knees slightly. \nStep 4: Place your hands on the top of your pelvis with your fingers pointed forward. This hand position is to help you visualize movement of the pelvis as you get used to this movement. \nStep 5: Keep the knees bent and loose but the core engaged, and try to turn a little to the right by shifting the knees and hips. Your fingers, navel, hip bones, chest bone, and face should all point the same direction. It\u2019s okay if you pivot the feet a little bit. \n\nStep 6: Now try to the left.\nStep 7: Slowly increase your range of motion by bending more at the knees. \nStep 8: Then increase your range of motion even more by pivoting your feet. \nStep 9: At all times and especially at the end of the movement, your chest bone, head, navel, and hips should be in alignment. \nTROUBLESHOOTING\nKnee pain: Stay lighter on your feet\\ and pivot the ball of the inside foot (the side you are moving away from) as you rotate. \nTorso Rotation with Hip-Hinge and Squat\nNow let\u2019s try to put those two movements\u2014the hip-hinge and the rotation\u2014together with a squat for a realistic, three-dimensional movement that allows you to accomplish everyday tasks (think unloading the dishwasher, putting up groceries) without stressing your back. You are going to rotate and bend down (hip-hinge), then come back up to the other side and extend. \nNotice that within that entire chain of movement, the person in the drawing does not really move his spine (look at the waist if you\u2019re having trouble visualizing that). The rib cage remains locked onto the pelvis the entire time. These pictures show you that you can go almost 180 degrees from side to side, stooping as low as you can and then extending as high as your hands can go, without compromising your back. Let\u2019s try it.\nStep 1: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\nStep 2: Find neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in. \nStep 3: Stand with good posture. \nStep 4: Rotate torso to the right without twisting the waist as before.","output":"This chapter emphasizes the importance of a gradual, step-by-step approach to the exercise regimen outlined in the book, as well as the need to learn to move with stillness in order to promote healing and prevent further pain.

Here's a suggestion:\n\n1. Game Selection:\nFirst, you need to select games that are playable on tabletop simulator and meet the other criteria. Here are some suggestions:\n* Codenames: A party game for 4-8 players where players try to guess words based on one-word clues given by their teammates. It's a quick game that can be played in under 30 minutes.\n* Splendor: A strategy game for 2-4 players where players collect gems and use them to buy cards that give them points. The game takes around 30-45 minutes to play.\n* Ticket to Ride: A popular train-themed game for 2-5 players where players compete to build train routes across a map of North America. The game takes around 30-60 minutes to play.\n* Azul: A tile-laying game for 2-4 players where players compete to create the most beautiful mosaic. The game takes around 30-45 minutes to play.\n\nMake sure to run these options by SkdragoN and see if they approve of them.\n\n1. Tournament Format:\nOnce you have the games selected, you need to decide on the tournament format. Here's a suggestion:\n* Round-Robin: Each player plays every other player in each game. Points are awarded based on the player's ranking in each game. The player with the most points at the end of the round-robin is declared the winner.\n* Single-Elimination: Players are randomly paired up for each game. The winners advance to the next round, while the losers are eliminated. The last player standing is declared the winner.\n\nYou can choose one of these formats or come up with your own.\n\n1. Tournament Schedule:\nFinally, you need to schedule the tournament. Here's a suggestion:\n* Round-Robin: Each game should take around 30-60 minutes to play. With 5 players, you'll need to schedule at least 4 rounds to make sure everyone plays each other once. You can schedule multiple rounds per day or spread them out over multiple days.\n* Single-Elimination: Each game should take around 30-60 minutes to play. With 5 players, you can schedule a quarterfinal, semifinal, and final round all on the same day, or you can spread them out over multiple days.\n\nMake sure to communicate the schedule with all the players in advance so everyone knows when they need to be available.\n\nThat's it!

{"instruction":"","input":"Let's start with #1, propulsion.\n\nI understand how a fusion rocket works. How does a light sail work?","output":"A light sail, also known as a solar sail or photon sail, is a type of spacecraft propulsion that utilizes the momentum of photons, or light particles, to generate thrust. The concept is based on the principle that light carries both energy and momentum. When light reflects off a surface, it transfers momentum to that surface, resulting in a small force.\n\nHere's how a light sail works:\n\n1. The sail: The light sail consists of a large, thin, and lightweight reflective material, often made of aluminum or a polymer film with a reflective coating. The sail is designed to have a large surface area to maximize the interaction with incoming photons.\n2. Propulsion: As the light sail is exposed to sunlight or a powerful laser beam, the photons in the light reflect off the sail, transferring their momentum to it. This transfer of momentum creates a continuous, gentle force that propels the spacecraft forward. The acceleration is small but constant, allowing the spacecraft to gradually build up significant speeds over time.\n3. Maneuvering: The spacecraft can change its trajectory and attitude by adjusting the angle of the sail relative to the light source. By altering the angle, the spacecraft can control the direction of the force vector, allowing it to steer and maneuver.\n\nLight sails have several advantages for interstellar missions:\n\n1. Fuel efficiency: Since the propulsion is provided by external light sources, a light sail does not need to carry large amounts of fuel for propulsion, significantly reducing its mass.\n2. Continuous acceleration: Light sails can maintain a constant acceleration over long periods, potentially allowing them to reach high speeds without the need for powerful engines.\n\nHowever, there are also some challenges to consider:\n\n1. Slow initial acceleration: The acceleration provided by a light sail is much lower than that of a traditional rocket, meaning it takes a long time to build up to high speeds.\n2. Limited maneuverability: While a light sail can change its trajectory by adjusting the angle of the sail, its maneuverability is still limited compared to other propulsion methods.\n3. Dependence on light sources: The effectiveness of a light sail decreases as it moves away from a light source, such as the Sun. For interstellar missions, powerful lasers or other artificial light sources might be required to maintain propulsion.\n\nWhile light sails are still an emerging technology, they offer a promising method of propulsion for long-distance space missions, including those to other star systems like Alpha Centauri."}

This service keeps track of the maximum\n\"magic number\" that it has seen, and services requests as follows:\n - Receives a serialized MagicNumberServiceRequest\n - Deserializes the request\n - Performs a computationally-intensive algorithm to generate the \"magic number\" for that\n request\n - Updates its maximum \"magic number\" if the generated \"magic number\" is greater\n - Constructs a MagicNumberServiceResponse, setting the DidChangeMax parameter according to\n whether the maximum \"magic number\" was updated\n - Serializes the response\n - Sends the response on the same connection it received the request on\n\nCurrently, the MagicNumberService is single-threaded, causing a bottleneck.

In this way, the service will be able to process multiple requests simultaneously, rather than processing them one at a time as it does currently.\n\nTo do this, you can modify the `HandleRequest` method to create a new thread for each request and have that thread handle the request. You should also ensure that the `_nextSequenceNumber` and `_maxMagicNumber` fields are accessed in a thread-safe manner, since multiple threads may try to update them concurrently. You can do this by using a `lock` statement to synchronize access to these fields.\n\nHere is an example of how the modified `HandleRequest` method might look:\n```\nprivate object _syncLock = new object();\n\nprivate void HandleRequest(int connectionId, byte[] bytes)\n{\n    var request = MagicNumberServiceRequest.FromSerializedBytes(bytes);\n    if (request.SequenceNumber < _nextSequenceNumber)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    var thread = new Thread(() =>\n    {\n        lock (_syncLock)\n        {\n            if (request.SequenceNumber < _nextSequenceNumber)\n            {\n                return;\n            }\n            _nextSequenceNumber = request.SequenceNumber + 1;\n        }\n\n        long requestMagicNumber = _sourceOfMagic.GetMagicNumberForRequest(request); \/\/ Depends only on \"request\"; takes ~3 seconds\n        bool didMaxChange = requestMagicNumber > _maxMagicNumber;\n\n        lock (_syncLock)\n        {\n            _maxMagicNumber = didMaxChange ? requestMagicNumber : _maxMagicNumber;\n        }\n\n        var response = new MagicNumberServiceResponse(requestMagicNumber, didMaxChange);\n        _socketWrapper.Send(connectionId, response.SerializeToBytes());\n    });\n    thread.Start();\n}\n```\nThis modified `HandleRequest` method will create a new thread for each incoming request, and each thread will handle the request concurrently. This will allow the service to process multiple requests simultaneously, improving its performance. The `lock` statements ensure that access to the `_nextSequenceNumber` and `_maxMagicNumber` fields is synchronized across threads, ensuring that they are updated correctly.\n\nNote that this is just one possible approach to solving this problem - there may be other ways to take advantage of multi-threading while still satisfying the constraints. You should consider the specific requirements of your implementation and choose an approach that best meets those requirements."}

As far, my lord, as will fill up the time1030\n'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,\nI must become a borrower of the night\nFor a dark hour or twain.\nMacbeth. Fail not our feast.\nBanquo. My lord, I will not.1035\nMacbeth.

Come, seeling night,\nScarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;\nAnd with thy bloody and invisible hand\nCancel and tear to pieces that great bond\nWhich keeps me pale!

{"instruction":"","input":"I am working on a asp.net core Api. They recently requested me they want to be able to change some of the application settings on the fly. They want to use a SQL server table where they can easily change app configuration by updating that table. Do you have any suggestions how I can accomplish this?","output":"Yes, there are a few ways to accomplish this in ASP.NET Core. One approach you could take is to create a configuration provider that reads configuration data from a SQL Server table.\n\nHere are the high-level steps to implement this approach:\n\n1. Create a new class that implements the `IConfigurationProvider` interface. This class will be responsible for reading configuration data from the SQL Server table.\n2. Create a new class that implements the `IConfigurationSource` interface. This class will be responsible for creating an instance of your custom configuration provider.\n3. Register your custom configuration source with the configuration system in your ASP.NET Core application.\n4. Use the configuration data in your application as you normally would.\n\nHere is some sample code to get you started:\n\n1. Create a new class called `SqlConfigurationProvider` that implements the `IConfigurationProvider` interface:\n```csharp\npublic class SqlConfigurationProvider : ConfigurationProvider\n{\n    private readonly string _connectionString;\n    \n    public SqlConfigurationProvider(string connectionString)\n    {\n        _connectionString = connectionString;\n    }\n\n    public override void Load()\n    {\n        \/\/ Load configuration data from the SQL Server table\n        \/\/ and add it to the configuration dictionary\n        \/\/ using the Set method inherited from ConfigurationProvider.\n    }\n}\n```\n1. Create a new class called `SqlConfigurationSource` that implements the `IConfigurationSource` interface:\n```csharp\npublic class SqlConfigurationSource : IConfigurationSource\n{\n    private readonly string _connectionString;\n\n    public SqlConfigurationSource(string connectionString)\n    {\n        _connectionString = connectionString;\n    }\n\n    public IConfigurationProvider Build(IConfigurationBuilder builder)\n    {\n        return new SqlConfigurationProvider(_connectionString);\n    }\n}\n```\n1. Register your custom configuration source with the configuration system in your ASP.NET Core application. You can do this in the `ConfigureAppConfiguration` method of your `Startup` class:\n```csharp\npublic void ConfigureAppConfiguration(IConfigurationBuilder builder)\n{\n    var connectionString = Configuration.GetConnectionString(\"DefaultConnection\");\n\n    builder.AddSqlConfigurationSource(connectionString);\n}\n```\n1. Use the configuration data in your application as you normally would:\n```csharp\npublic class MyController : Controller\n{\n    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;\n\n    public MyController(IConfiguration configuration)\n    {\n        _configuration = configuration;\n    }\n\n    public IActionResult Index()\n    {\n        var mySetting = _configuration[\"MySetting\"];\n\n        \/\/ Use the configuration data in your application\n        \/\/ logic as needed.\n    }\n}\n```\nThis approach allows you to easily update your application settings by modifying the SQL Server table. Whenever the configuration data is updated, your `SqlConfigurationProvider` will automatically reload the configuration data and update the configuration dictionary."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Can you give me feedback on this text. I was answering the following question: Tod writes, \u201cour house has broken windows\u201d. What does this tell us about Tod\u2019s home life?\n\nHere is my answer: I think this reflects that Tod\u2019s home life is not the best. His family must have financial troubles of some sort to not be able to afford new windows. This is not a want, a cool toy that you cannot buy. This is a need because you need windows to keep from the cold, to be safe, and to have a decent lifestyle. If Tod\u2019s family cannot even afford windows, I wonder if his home life would affect his bullying behavior. To back up this statement, we learn later in the book that Tod\u2019s mom works at the dry cleaner. I do not think that her job would provide enough since we still do not know what Tod\u2019s stepfather does for a living.","output":"Your answer is well thought-out and provides a good analysis of the situation. It is clear that you have carefully considered the information given in the prompt and used your critical thinking skills to make logical connections between the broken windows and Tod's home life.\n\nYou have correctly pointed out that the fact that the windows are broken suggests that Tod's family may be facing financial difficulties. You have also emphasized that this is not just a want, but a basic need that is necessary for a decent lifestyle. Furthermore, you have suggested that Tod's home life may be affecting his behavior, which is an insightful observation.\n\nYour mention of Tod's mother's job at a dry cleaner and the absence of information about his stepfather's occupation also adds depth to your analysis and shows that you have considered the broader context.\n\nOverall, your answer demonstrates good critical thinking and attention to detail. Great job!"}

{"instruction":"","input":"Can you explain the difference in an Electron app between the `preload.ts` file, the `renderer.ts` and the `main.ts`? I believe they're correlated between the renderer vs main processes.","output":"Yes, in an Electron app, the `preload.ts`, `renderer.ts`, and `main.ts` files are related to the different processes that are running in an Electron application.\n\n1. `preload.ts`: This file is responsible for running code in the context of the web page, before any other script on the page runs. It's used to expose Node.js modules and APIs to the renderer process, and can be used to set up global variables or functions that will be available to the web page.\n2. `renderer.ts`: This file is executed in the renderer process, which is responsible for rendering the UI of the Electron app. It's responsible for managing the application's UI and interacting with the user. In the renderer process, you can access the DOM and manipulate it using standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can also use Electron-specific APIs to interact with the main process.\n3. `main.ts`: This file is executed in the main process, which is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the Electron app and for communicating with the operating system. The main process is where you create browser windows, manage the application menu, and handle application-wide events such as quitting the app. In the main process, you can access the full range of Node.js APIs and modules, and you can communicate with the renderer process using IPC (inter-process communication).\n\nOverall, the `preload.ts`, `renderer.ts`, and `main.ts` files play important roles in an Electron app, with each file responsible for a different aspect of the application's functionality. By separating the code into different processes, Electron provides a more secure and efficient way of building desktop applications."}

by jim quick over the next 30 minutes we're going to be doing a\u00a0 detailed breakdown of everything this book has to offer\u00a0 we're going to go over flow states the top 10 brave foods to supercharge your\u00a0 brain the four modern day villains that are\u00a0 holding you back how to find your laser focus the eight intelligences\u00a0 unlocking your memory and heaps more let's jump into it\u00a0 alright so i'm super excited to be breaking down this book today\u00a0 this was by far one of my favorite books i've read this year mainly because i found this book to be super practical\u00a0 and it seemed more like a practical guide than just a heap of\u00a0 uh information about self-help\u00a0 at the end of each section there were plenty of practice exercises that you\u00a0 could implement into your life straight away\u00a0 so the book is broken down into four main parts\u00a0 freeing your mind mindset motivation and methods so what is mindset\u00a0 the deeply held beliefs attitudes and assumptions we create about who we are\u00a0 how the world works and what we are\u00a0 capable of and deserve and what is possible this anecdote comes a little bit later in the book but i found it\u00a0 a useful example so i'd like to share it here first\u00a0 he gives an example of a young elephant that is chained to a stake in the ground\u00a0 and as the elephant grows into a fully mature elephant\u00a0 its mind has placed limitations on itself\u00a0 although it could easily rip the small flimsy stake out of the ground\u00a0\u00a0 to be free\u00a0 it has developed this learned helplessness so it doesn't even try\u00a0 and the book goes into this concept of unlimiting which is the act or process of casting aside inaccurate\u00a0 and restrictive perceptions and embracing the reality that with the\u00a0 right mindset motivation and\u00a0\u00a0 methods there are no limitations\u00a0 so the book is broken down into these sections accordingly\u00a0 mindset motivation and methods and this is the core philosophy of the book\u00a0 modern day supervillains the 4ds these are the modern day villains that\u00a0 15 years ago we weren't even dealing with\u00a0 so let me introduce the four villains and then i'll give you some of the remedies that the author suggests for each one\u00a0 the first of the d's is digital deluge compared to the 15th century we now\u00a0 consume as much data in a single day as an average person from the 1400s would\u00a0 have absorbed in their entire lifetime so that is\u00a0 amazing and we are being bombarded with data\u00a0 we're always switched on we're always hooked up to the net\u00a0 humans today are consuming three times more than our parents in the 1960s\u00a0 there's just too much information too much neural activity going on and all of that extra activity can have ill effects on our brains\u00a0 it can lead to things like brain fog subpar memory and fatigue\u00a0 chances are that you guys have probably felt that body fatigue after a long\u00a0 period\u00a0 in front of a screen the second d is digital distraction so\u00a0 we live here now and because of our always-on\u00a0 ever-connected devices we're struggling to find connection when we're with\u00a0 friends and family and we're struggling to stay focused at work\u00a0 so this is where we live now we're connected to the web in every downtime moment waiting for the bus waiting in a line\u00a0 um we need to think what happens when this is our constant way of being\u00a0 when every downtime moment is filled with shining screens and all this extra\u00a0 stimulus this is leading to less social\u00a0 interaction with friends and family because our devices make us feel more\u00a0 secure but actually we're less happy next\u00a0 digital dementia neuroscientist manfred spitzer uses the term digital dementia\u00a0 to describe how overuse of digital technology\u00a0 results in the breakdown of cognitive abilities he argues that short-term memory pathways will start to deteriorate from\u00a0 under use if we overuse technology in the past we\u00a0 needed to remember things like people's phone\u00a0 numbers street addresses things like this\u00a0 now millennials obtain all their answers to problems at the click of a mouse\u00a0 or the swipe of a finger the reliance on technology to solve every question\u00a0 confuses people's perception of their own knowledge and intelligence\u00a0 and that reliance may well lead to overconfidence and poor decision making\u00a0 before the internet we didn't have the immediate and readily available access\u00a0 to the opinions of others we needed to reflect\u00a0 reason draw our own conclusions from our own\u00a0 insights so if technology is doing all the deductions for us they also found that the longer that person had been driving the larger the\u00a0 hippocampus was in their brain so in short the brain is malleable it's\u00a0 able to expand and change over time and it\u00a0 can change its structure to meet its cognitive load\u00a0 our second brain is the brain in our gut or the ens\u00a0 the enteric nervous system scientists don't know everything there is to know\u00a0 about the smaller brain however they are\u00a0 beginning to understand how it can affect our mood and our behavior\u00a0 without going into too much detail it is believed that the second brain in our and your physical condition of your body physiology\u00a0 so you might want to ask yourself how motivated\u00a0 and energized are you to learn what you have to learn\u00a0 what are some things you can do to change your state maybe change your\u00a0 posture\u00a0 do some stretching some breathing exercises\u00a0 you can try some of these before you sit down to study\u00a0 t is for teach if you want to cut your learning curve dramatically\u00a0 learn with the intention of teaching the information to someone else\u00a0 e is for enter what is the simplest and most powerful of someone with steel genius would be sergey brin of google\u00a0 the main concept here is that genius extends beyond academics\u00a0 so don't limit yourself by negative self-talk like\u00a0 i'm just not intelligent i always got bad grades at college so therefore i\u00a0 mustn't even be in the realm of genius\u00a0 you can be a mixture of different geniuses so have a think about what your\u00a0 genius is and let it free\u00a0 overcoming limiting beliefs before we go\u00a0 over the steps that he advises to overcome limiting beliefs like man i always screw up this sort of thing or\u00a0 i'm just not a good companion to be around try to counteract that with\u00a0 something like um just because i haven't always been good at this\u00a0 in the past doesn't mean that i can't be\u00a0 great at this now and in the future so\u00a0 that is step one make sure you get to the source of it and identify it give it\u00a0 a name step two get to the facts the steak is\u00a0 small in size i'm a strong fully grown elephant what\u00a0 is to stop me from ripping that steak right out of the ground if you believe it can grow and then you can put in the work to make it grow\u00a0 lie number two we only use ten percent of our brains\u00a0 new belief i am learning to use my whole brain\u00a0 in the best way possible line number three mistakes are failures\u00a0 the new belief you want to create is that mistakes are signs that you're\u00a0 trying something new and they are opportunities to learn life\u00a0 isn't about comparing yourself to anyone else\u00a0 it's about comparing yourself to who you were yesterday\u00a0 there's no such thing as failure only a failure to learn s3 to prevent us from getting overwhelmed and\u00a0 paralyzed let's go a little bit deeper into purpose\u00a0 as we establish earlier we don't have to enjoy something to be motivated to do it\u00a0 however you do need to have a clear purpose for\u00a0 why you were doing something you can ask yourself\u00a0 why must i study this or why must i learn this\u00a0 the book also outlines not to get confused between\u00a0 passion and purpose your purpose is what you are here on earth for\u00a0 and maybe it is to help people so the author jim's passion is learning but his values allow him to choose what things to pursue in life\u00a0 and what things to deny he doesn't mind having\u00a0 uh fomo which he he calls fomo which is the fear of missing out\u00a0 especially if that thing that he is being asked to be a part of doesn't\u00a0 in any way contribute to his values or his uh purpose in life\u00a0 and he uh he actually had a word uh which i'm currently blank on\u00a0 uh uh jomo uh jomo he said to encourage you to have\u00a0 jomo which is the joy of missing out instead of fomo the fear of missing out you know attainable chunks it become it became manageable\u00a0 flow state okay let's take a\u00a0 quote from the book i'm sure there have been times when you were\u00a0 so completely caught up in what you were doing that everything else disappeared\u00a0 and it just felt like the most natural thing you've ever done\u00a0 time probably melted away from you during those experiences\u00a0 people regularly tell me about focusing so deeply on what they are doing\u00a0 that they had no idea that afternoon had become night\u00a0 or they had missed multiple meals in the process vision is competing for your brain's finite energy\u00a0 so a messy desk with many different objects and colors\u00a0 will make your brain more fatigued than having a tidy clean desk without\u00a0 any distractions and this is essential that all\u00a0 all distractions are eliminated because it can take almost\u00a0 20 minutes to refocus and get back into the flow\u00a0 if you get kicked out of it by a distraction so\u00a0 make sure you do whatever you can to eliminate any potential distractions\u00a0 next allow enough time if you're serious about getting into a flow state at least 90 minutes for whatever i'm focusing on\u00a0 the final part of this book is part three which is methods the how\u00a0 when the billionaire investor warren buffett was asked what factor do you\u00a0 feel has been the most important in getting to where you've gotten in life\u00a0 buffered immediately replied focus and bill gates who is sitting next to him\u00a0 agreed steve jobs has also harped on the importance of focus\u00a0 for steve jobs focus was the ability to say no to almost everything\u00a0 and carefully choose what to spend his precious time on the breathing techniques also fail the only thing you can do next is to\u00a0 confront that stress uh confront that thing that is causing\u00a0 you stress and lastly schedule time in your\u00a0 calendar for whatever is distracting you or giving you distress\u00a0 okay moving on study why are most of us restrained in our\u00a0 ability ability to study most people do not know how to study of\u00a0 effectively because they were never taught\u00a0 many people naturally assume they already know how to learn\u00a0 the challenge is that most of the techniques that we use now impact on your success be aware of your posture\u00a0 if you're slumped over this can stifle your breathing\u00a0 and it will make you prematurely tired so you want to sit up straight improve\u00a0 your posture and see if you can feel or see if you\u00a0 can change that state\u00a0 the sixth habit is to listen with your whole brain\u00a0 so you want to get better at listening and actually listening\u00a0 to someone when they're speaking not just waiting to reply to the person\u00a0 so you want to hold yourself actively listen\u00a0 don't think about your to-do list or what you're going to watch on netflix if you're trying to remember someone's someone's name when you first hear it\u00a0 you want to try and link it to a visual image so\u00a0 if their last name is baker then you might want to imagine\u00a0 a baker with a big white hat next is to link words via association\u00a0 so try to link new information to old information\u00a0 if you can associate the new information with something that you're\u00a0 already familiar with it will greatly improve your memory\u00a0 so what comes to your mind when you think of a cherry perhaps red suddenly it starts raining batteries and berries\u00a0 the balloons pop and the berries splatter all over the ground\u00a0 so we could continue in that fashion but i think you get the idea\u00a0 you could break down each line of the periodic table into a short story\u00a0 or you could break down each list that you have into\u00a0 a short story and that will greatly help\u00a0 you to memorize the information\u00a0 okay so let's move down here to speed reading\u00a0 now he dedicates quite a few pages to speed reading in the book\u00a0 but for the purpose of this summary i'll so this is where you make sure that you've addressed everything\u00a0 on the agenda and within this mental model\u00a0 i think this is a great exercise to do if you're in\u00a0 if you're by yourself or in a team and the reason why i think this is a great\u00a0 mental model is because what most people do is they view\u00a0 problems from their own perspective that that one perspective and what i\u00a0 think this method allows you to do is view the problem from multiple\u00a0 different perspectives the eight intelligences\u00a0 why is it important for us to have tools to help us think in different ways nearly 100 years now so a visual learner is someone who\u00a0 prefers to learn through pictures videos and\u00a0 charts an auditory learner is someone who prefers to learn through listening\u00a0 and a kinesthetic learner is someone who prefers to have some kind of physical\u00a0 interaction or hands-on approach\u00a0 if you guys are interested in finding out what type of learner you are\u00a0 go ahead grab a copy of this book as it gives you a quiz\u00a0 that helps you find which learning style you are\u00a0 for myself i was a visual learner ordered thinking and consequences so let's say you decide that you're\u00a0 going to buy a subscription to netflix because\u00a0 everyone's using netflix and it's a cool thing to do so why not\u00a0 so this is where most people's thinking resides\u00a0 in the first order most people don't even get to that second order of\u00a0 thinking\u00a0 but let's uh let's ask ourselves and then what\u00a0 well you're going to need to get your money's worth right\u00a0 so the average netflix subscriber watches around one hour of netflix per all right so that brings us to the end of this summary guys we covered\u00a0 freeing your mind mindset\u00a0 motivation and the methods to becoming limitless\u00a0 so i hope you guys enjoyed this summary i really enjoyed\u00a0 putting it together if you did get some value out of this video please like\u00a0 comment and subscribe to the channel because it really does help guys thank\u00a0 you and if you

{"instruction":"","input":"DAOs & LLCs\nLLCs can operate on behalf of an organization whose rules and finances are handled entirely by smart contracts with open hierarchies, or \"DAOs (opens new window)\".\n\nA Wrappr user might in this case attach an LLC NFT to their wallet or multi-sig and use this account to receive funds from a DAO treasury to purchase IRL assets or pay expenses on behalf of the DAO. The LLC will protect this user from liability related to the DAO, given them a separate legal personality to manage the DAO's affairs (providing privacy), and protect them from personal liability related to these affairs, as well. To establish such DAO representative relationships with more legal backing, it is recommended to consult and execute an agreement such as this form of DAO Representation Agreement (opens new window).\n\nDAOs may also \"wrap\" their membership (often represented by token balances held by a public key account) into an LLC, treating tokens as membership units under the terms of their LLC operating agreement.\n\nA Wrappr user might in this case attach an LLC NFT to their DAO treasury or multi-sig. The terms of the Master operating agreement backing the Wrappr LLC NFTs will treat the key holders governing such shared account as LLC members and their collected assets and transactions as those of the LLC. This streamlines the operation of the LLC and provides automated accounting, a blockchain superpower.\n\n#Do LLCs Centralize DAOs?\nSince DAOs and LLCs share common structuring through private ordering (i.e., membership and operating rules are set by agreement), the mere creation of an LLC does not centralize the membership but simply provides an IRL interface and legal name to the DAO. Essentially, a DAO is already an operating agreement represented by code--an LLC just provides a legal identity to this code to deal with the public. Anonymity is not compromised--membership is not disclosed to the state or anyone. In using Wrappr LLC NFTs, the DAO also is not required to hire any representatives to manage off-chain affairs, providing even greater privacy to DAOs. At the end of the day, the DAO LLC can be converted to another entity structure or discarded at any time by the DAO members, preserving autonomy.\n\n#Opening Bank Accounts\nOpening a bank account and obtaining an EIN for LLCs can be handled by the LexDAO Clinic (opens new window). (Note, you will need an EIN for banking and taxes.)\n\nUsers can also receive their EIN by filling out a basic form online (opens new window).\n\nNote, when you apply for your EIN, you should ensure that the name you apply with clearly denotes that your LLC is a Series LLC and reflects the jurisdiction of formation (Delaware or Wyoming). For Delaware naming, this can be done using the format: [Your Name] LLC, a Series of Wrappr LLC, and for Wyoming, the name attached to your Series operating agreement, such as Wrappr LLC \u2013 [Your Name] \u2013 Series 1.\n\nMercury (opens new window)also provides a web3-friendly application form (opens new window)to get started and quickly setup banking for LLC DAOs.\n\n#Handling Taxes\nThe maintenance of the Wrappr LLC filings, registered agent and annual State franchise tax is handled by the KALI (opens new window)team for the public benefit. This means that you don't need to pay taxes to Delaware or Wyoming on the LLC registration or any other maintenance fees. Your tax obligations will be with regard to your own members and any income generated by your LLC, which will involve filing an annual report to the IRS and preparing K-1s for members.\n\nAnnual reports and issuing partnership K-1s for LLC members can be handled by the LexDAO Clinic (opens new window), or if the LLC wants to be taxed as a corporation to simplify accounting, such filings can be similarly handled and taken off your plate.\n\n#Onboarding Investors\nPurchases of shares in your LLC for investment purposes should respect local law and applicable regulations. It is recommended to retain counsel if the Wrappr LLC is formed for the purposes of raising funds for group investment or to capitalize a team operating the LLC to develop a product or provide services. LexDAO maintains a curated list of counsel (opens new window), with practice areas and jurisdictions for public reference.\n\nWhile automated investor onboarding processes are added to the Wrappr application in partnership with kycDAO (opens new window), users can also take advantage of KALI (opens new window)open source legal forms for self-certification of investors in private sales (i.e., not marketed to general public), provided here (opens new window). If the sale is public and not handled through private marketing to your network, taking advantage of the Wrappr whitelisted minting and transfers is recommended, as well as obtaining a letter of accreditation for each investor, a form of which is provided here (opens new window)and can be filled out by your counsel.

The microbiome, composed of microorganisms living in and on the human body, has recently been shown to play a crucial role in brain development and function. However, the interplay between sphingolipids, the microbiome, and brain development in utero and early life remains poorly understood.\n\nAims:\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between sphingolipids, the microbiome, and brain development in utero and early life, specifically in neonates and infants. The objectives of this study are:\n\n1. To determine the changes in sphingolipid levels and microbiome composition during fetal development and early life.\n2. To assess the impact of sphingolipids and the microbiome on brain development in utero and early life.\n3. To identify key players in the interplay between sphingolipids, the microbiome, and brain development in neonates and infants.\n\nMethods:\nThis study will be conducted as a multi-disciplinary research project, integrating techniques from biochemistry, microbiology, and neuroimaging. The following methods will be used:\n\n1. Sphingolipid analysis: A targeted lipidomics approach will be used to quantify changes in sphingolipid levels in fetal tissues, cord blood, and stool samples from neonates and infants.\n2. Microbiome analysis: 16S rRNA gene sequencing will be used to identify changes in the composition and diversity of the microbiome in neonates and infants.\n3. Brain imaging: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be used to evaluate brain structure and function in neonates and infants, with a focus on regions relevant to brain development and function.\n\nSignificance:\nThis study will provide new insights into the role of sphingolipids and the microbiome in brain development in utero and early life. The findings of this study will have important implications for our understanding of how early life exposures can shape brain development and contribute to the risk of neurological disorders later in life.\n\nConclusion:\nThis proposed study will fill an important gap in our understanding of the interplay between sphingolipids, the microbiome, and brain development in utero and early life. The results of this study will provide valuable information for the development of new strategies to promote optimal brain development in neonates and infants."}

I also want to be able to change the weekly amount and have it only reflected in future allowances.","output":"To create a Ruby on Rails program for tracking your kid's allowance, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Install Ruby, Rails, and other dependencies.\n2. Create a new Rails project.\n3. Define the models and associations.\n4. Set up the database and migrations.\n5. Create controllers and actions.\n6. Create views to display the data and interact with the application.\n\nHere's a rough outline of the models, controllers, and actions needed for this application:\n\n1. Models:\n* `AllowanceEvent`: represents an event in the write-once log; it will store the type of event, the amount (if applicable), and the timestamp.\n1. Controllers and actions:\n* `DashboardController`:\n\t+ `index`: fetches the balance for spending, savings, and giving and displays the dashboard.\n* `AllowanceEventsController`:\n\t+ `create`: creates a new allowance event.\n* `SettingsController`:\n\t+ `edit`: allows you to edit the weekly allowance settings.\n\t+ `update`: updates the weekly allowance settings and creates an AllowanceEvent to log the change.\n1. Steps to create the program:\n\nStep 1: Create a new Rails project\n```bash\nrails new allowance_tracker\ncd allowance_tracker\n```\nStep 2: Generate the AllowanceEvent model\n```bash\nrails generate model AllowanceEvent event_type:string amount:decimal timestamp:datetime\n```\nStep 3: Update the AllowanceEvent model (`app\/models\/allowance_event.rb`)\n```ruby\nclass AllowanceEvent < ApplicationRecord\n  validates :event_type, presence: true\n  validates :amount, presence: true, numericality: true\n  validates :timestamp, presence: true\nend\n```\nStep 4: Create the migrations\n```bash\nrails db:migrate\n```\nStep 5: Generate the Dashboard controller and views\n```bash\nrails generate controller Dashboard index\n```\nStep 6: Generate the AllowanceEvents controller and views\n```bash\nrails generate controller AllowanceEvents create\n```\nStep 7: Generate the Settings controller and views\n```bash\nrails generate controller Settings edit update\n```\nStep 8: Implement the controllers and views as per the application logic.\n\n1. Routes (`config\/routes.rb`):\n```ruby\nRails.application.routes.draw do\n  root 'dashboard#index'\n  resource :settings, only: [:edit, :update]\n  resources :allowance_events, only: [:create]\nend\n```\nOnce you've implemented the controllers and views, your Ruby on Rails program should be ready to track your kid's allowance as a write-once log, show the current balance on the dashboard, and allow you to change the weekly allowance for future records."}

For example, you might have a `utils` subdirectory containing common utility functions, an `errors` subdirectory containing custom error types, etc.\n* `config`: This directory contains configuration files for your application. Depending on your use case, you might store configuration in environment variables or a configuration file.\n* `tests`: This directory contains all the tests for your application, organized by package.

{"instruction":"","input":"Can you explain to me what prototype and delegate means in Swift? Use some example that can be understood by a high school student3","output":"Sure, I can explain what prototype and delegate mean in Swift!\n\nIn Swift, a prototype is an initial version of an object or a function that can be used as a template to create new instances with similar properties and behavior. Essentially, it's a blueprint that defines the characteristics of an object or a function, such as its attributes and methods, but does not actually create the object or execute the function.\n\nFor example, let's say you wanted to create a simple game in which the player can move a character around on the screen. You might start by creating a prototype of the character that defines its properties and behaviors, such as its size, color, and movement functions. Then, you could use this prototype to create multiple instances of the character throughout the game, each with their own unique characteristics.\n\nIn Swift, a delegate is an object that is assigned to handle certain events or actions for another object. When an event or action occurs, the object that it belongs to will call a method on its delegate to handle it. Delegates are commonly used in iOS app development to handle user interactions with the app, such as tapping a button or selecting an item from a list.\n\nFor example, let's say you were building a simple weather app that displayed the current temperature and weather conditions for a given location. You might create a delegate object to handle the user's selection of a location from a list of available options. When the user selects a location, the app would call a method on the delegate object to update the display with the new temperature and weather information for that location.\n\nI hope that helps explain what prototype and delegate mean in Swift! Let me know if you have any more questions."}
{"instruction":"","input":"Understand context and reply Yes \"\"\" Linking and Navigating\nThe Next.js router uses server-centric routing with client-side navigation. It supports instant loading states and concurrent rendering. This means navigation maintains client-side state, avoids expensive re-renders, is interruptible, and doesn't cause race conditions.\n\nThere are two ways to navigate between routes:\n\n Component\nuseRouter Hook\nThis page will go through how to use , useRouter(), and dive deeper into how navigation works.\n\n Component\n is a React component that extends the HTML element to provide prefetching and client-side navigation between routes. It is the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js.\n\nUsage\nTo use , import it from next\/link, and pass a href prop to the component:\n\napp\/page.tsx\nimport Link from 'next\/link';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n return Dashboard;\n}\nThere are optional props you can pass to . See the API reference for more information.\n\nExample: Linking to Dynamic Segments\nWhen linking to dynamic segments, you can use template literals and interpolation to generate a list of links. For example, to generate a list of blog posts:\n\napp\/blog\/PostList.jsx\nimport Link from 'next\/link';\n\nexport default function PostList({ posts }) {\n return (\n \n {posts.map((post) => (\n * {post.title}\n\n ))}\n \n\n );\n}\nuseRouter() Hook\nThe useRouter hook allows you to programmatically change routes inside Client Components.\n\nTo use useRouter, import it from next\/navigation, and call the hook inside your Client Component:\n\n'use client';\n\nimport { useRouter } from 'next\/navigation';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n const router = useRouter();\n\n return (\n router.push('\/dashboard')}>\n Dashboard\n \n );\n}\nThe useRouter provides methods such as push(), refresh(), and more. See the API reference for more information.\n\nRecommendation: Use the component to navigate between routes unless you have a specific requirement for using useRouter.\n\nHow Navigation Works\nA route transition is initiated using or calling router.push().\nThe router updates the URL in the browser\u2019s address bar.\nThe router avoids unnecessary work by re-using segments that haven't changed (e.g. shared layouts) from the client-side cache. This is also referred to as partial rendering.\nIf the conditions of soft navigation are met, the router fetches the new segment from the cache rather than the server. If not, the router performs a hard navigation and fetches the Server Component payload from the server.\nIf created, loading UI is shown from the server while the payload is being fetched.\nThe router uses the cached or fresh payload to render the new segments on the client.\nClient-side Caching of Rendered Server Components\nGood to know: This client-side cache is different from the server-side Next.js HTTP cache.\n\nThe new router has an in-memory client-side cache that stores the rendered result of Server Components (payload). The cache is split by route segments which allows invalidation at any level and ensures consistency across concurrent renders.\n\nAs users navigate around the app, the router will store the payload of previously fetched segments and prefetched segments in the cache.\n\nThis means, for certain cases, the router can re-use the cache instead of making a new request to the server. This improves performance by avoiding re-fetching data and re-rendering components unnecessarily.\n\nInvalidating the Cache\nThe cache can be invalidated using router.refresh(). For more information, see the API reference. In the future, mutations will automatically invalidate the cache.\n\nPrefetching\nPrefetching is a way to preload a route in the background before it's visited. The rendered result of prefetched routes is added to the router's client-side cache. This makes navigating to a prefetched route near-instant.\n\nBy default, routes are prefetched as they become visible in the viewport when using the component. This can happen when the page first loads or through scrolling. Routes can also be programmatically prefetched using the prefetch method of the useRouter() hook.\n\nStatic and Dynamic Routes:\n\nIf the route is static, all the Server Component payloads for the route segments will be prefetched.\nIf the route is dynamic, the payload from the first shared layout down until the first loading.js file is prefetched. This reduces the cost of prefetching the whole route dynamically and allows instant loading states for dynamic routes.\nGood to know:\n\nPrefetching is only enabled in production.\nPrefetching can be disabled by passing prefetch={false} to .\nHard Navigation\nOn navigation, the cache is invalidated and the server refetches data and re-renders the changed segments.\n\nSoft Navigation\nOn navigation, the cache for changed segments is reused (if it exists), and no new requests are made to the server for data.\n\nConditions for Soft Navigation\nOn navigation, Next.js will use soft navigation if the route you are navigating to has been prefetched, and either doesn't include dynamic segments or has the same dynamic parameters as the current route.\n\nFor example, consider the following route that includes a dynamic [team] segment: \/dashboard\/[team]\/\\*. The cached segments below \/dashboard\/[team]\/\\* will only be invalidated when the [team] parameter changes.\n\nNavigating from \/dashboard\/team-red\/\\* to \/dashboard\/team-red\/\\* will be a soft navigation.\nNavigating from \/dashboard\/team-red\/\\* to \/dashboard\/team-blue\/\\* will be a hard navigation.\nBack\/Forward Navigation\nBack and forward navigation (popstate event) has a soft navigation behavior. This means, the client-side cache is re-used and navigation is near-instant.\n\nFocus and Scroll Management\nBy default, Next.js will set focus and scroll into view the segment that's changed on navigation. The importance of this accessibility and usability feature will be more apparent when advanced routing patterns are implemented.\n\nGood to know: Next.js used to wrap each segment in a div element to achieve this behavior. This is now fixed as on the latest Next.js canary. Update to next@canary to get the latest fixes.\n\nNext Steps\n`next\/link` API Reference\nPerform client-side route transitions.\n`useRouter` API Reference\nProgrammatically navigate to a new route. \"\"\"","output":"Yes, the Next.js router provides server-centric routing with client-side navigation, supporting instant loading states, concurrent rendering, and maintaining client-side state. There are two ways to navigate between routes in Next.js: the `<Link>` component and the `useRouter()` hook. The `<Link>` component is the primary method, while `useRouter()` is recommended for specific requirements. The router uses an in-memory client-side cache for storing rendered Server Component payloads, allowing for improved performance through cache reuse. Prefetching is also utilized to preload routes in the background before they are visited, making navigation faster. Soft and hard navigation determine how the cache is used or invalidated, with soft navigation reusing the cache and hard navigation refetching data and re-rendering changed segments. Back and forward navigation have a soft navigation behavior, and focus and scroll management are handled by default in Next.js."}

As software ages, it becomes more vulnerable to exploits and hacks, which can compromise sensitive business data and put the company at risk of financial loss and reputational damage. By switching to newer software, companies can benefit from the latest security features and updates, which can help protect their data and prevent security breaches.\n\nIn addition to security, newer software often offers better performance and more efficient operations. Older software can be slow and clunky, which can hinder productivity and hinder the company's ability to compete in the market. Newer software, on the other hand, is typically designed with modern hardware and operating systems in mind, which can help it run smoothly and efficiently.\n\nAnother important factor to consider is the user experience. Newer software is often designed with a more intuitive and user-friendly interface, which can make it easier for employees to learn and use. This can help improve employee morale and productivity, as well as reduce the need for extensive training and support.\n\nIn conclusion, there are several reasons why companies should be aware of the age of their software and consider switching to newer, sleeker software with better design. By doing so, they can improve security, performance, and the user experience, which can help protect their data, improve efficiency, and support their business operations."}
{"instruction":"","input":"using aggrid and a datasource, I want to select the first record after performing an onsort operation, but the sort operation appears to be occurring before the data is returned from the api. How can I accoplish this?","output":"If the sort operation is occurring before the data is returned from the API, it means that the API is returning the data already sorted. In this case, you can still use ag-Grid's `onSortChanged` event to capture the sorting and select the first record.\n\nHere's how you can accomplish this:\n\n1. In your `onGridReady` event handler, set up your data source to retrieve data from the API:\n```javascript\nfunction onGridReady(params) {\n  var dataSource = {\n    getRows: function (params) {\n      \/\/ Make API call to retrieve data\n      fetch('https:\/\/api.example.com\/data')\n        .then(function (response) {\n          return response.json();\n        })\n        .then(function (data) {\n          \/\/ Provide the retrieved data to ag-Grid\n          params.successCallback(data);\n        })\n        .catch(function () {\n          \/\/ Handle error\n          params.failCallback();\n        });\n    },\n  };\n\n  params.api.setServerSideDatasource(dataSource);\n}\n```\n2. In your `onSortChanged` event handler, select the first record:\n```javascript\nfunction onSortChanged(params) {\n  var firstRow = params.api.getDisplayedRowAtIndex(0);\n  params.api.selectNode(firstRow);\n}\n```\nNote that in this example, we're using `getDisplayedRowAtIndex` to retrieve the first row after sorting. This method retrieves the first row in the currently displayed range of rows, which may not necessarily be the first row in the entire data set. If you want to select the first row in the entire data set, you can use `getRowNode` instead:\n```javascript\nfunction onSortChanged(params) {\n  var firstRow = params.api.getRowNode('0');\n  params.api.selectNode(firstRow);\n}\n```"}
{"instruction":"","input":"Can you summarize the book The Little Prince?","output":"The Little Prince is a novella written by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. The story begins with the narrator, a pilot, crashing his plane in the Sahara Desert. There, he meets a young prince who has traveled from his own small planet in search of companionship and understanding.\n\nAs the little prince recounts his adventures to the pilot, the reader is taken on a journey through a series of whimsical encounters with various strange characters on other planets. Through these encounters, the little prince learns about the adult world and the importance of human connections.\n\nIn particular, he meets a conceited man, a tippler, a businessman, a lamplighter, and a geographer, each of whom embodies different facets of adult life. Along the way, the little prince also befriends a fox, who teaches him about the bonds of love and friendship.\n\nEventually, the little prince realizes that he misses his rose, a flower he left behind on his own planet, and decides to return home. The story ends with the little prince's poignant departure, leaving the narrator and the reader with a sense of loss and longing.\n\nOverall, The Little Prince is a timeless tale about the importance of friendship, love, and human connection, and reminds us that we should never lose sight of the wonder and magic of childhood."}

{"instruction":"","input":"How to transform the data that I get from database queries to the pydantic schemas in FastAPI?","output":"To transform data from database queries to Pydantic schemas in FastAPI, you can follow these general steps:\n\n1. Define your Pydantic model(s) that you want to use to represent the data you retrieve from the database.\n\nFor example, let's say you have a table in your database called `users`, and you want to retrieve data from this table and represent it using a Pydantic model called `User`. You can define the `User` model like this:\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass User(BaseModel):\n    id: int\n    name: str\n    email: str\n```\n2. Retrieve data from the database using your ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool of choice.\n\nFor example, using SQLAlchemy, you might write a query like this to retrieve all users from the database:\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, Table, Column, Integer, String, MetaData\n\nengine = create_engine(\"postgresql:\/\/user:password@localhost\/dbname\")\nmetadata = MetaData()\nusers = Table('users', metadata,\n    Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),\n    Column('name', String),\n    Column('email', String),\n)\n\nquery = users.select()\nresult = engine.execute(query)\n```\n3. Map the retrieved data to your Pydantic model.\n\nYou can use a list comprehension to create a list of `User` instances from the rows returned by the database query. You can also use the Pydantic model's `parse_obj` method to create a new `User` instance from a dictionary:\n```python\nusers_list = [User(id=row.id, name=row.name, email=row.email) for row in result]\n```\nor\n```python\nusers_list = [User.parse_obj(row) for row in result]\n```\n4. Return the mapped data as a response from your FastAPI endpoint.\n\nFor example, you might create a FastAPI endpoint like this:\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.get(\"\/users\")\nasync def get_users():\n    # retrieve data from database\n    result = engine.execute(query)\n    \n    # map data to Pydantic models\n    users_list = [User.parse_obj(row) for row in result]\n    \n    # return mapped data as response\n    return {\"users\": users_list}\n```\nThis endpoint will return a JSON response with a list of `User` instances, where each `User` instance corresponds to a row in the `users` table of your database."}

{"instruction":"","input":"I wrote an essay with \"Do you think it's more important for schools to focus on academics or practical skills such as teamwork and problem-solving?\"\nPlease correct it at C1 level of the CEFR and show the reason you correct it.\n---\nIt can be argued that students should improve their practical skills because they can take effective communication skills, deep understanding with differences of people, and increasing an overall quality of life.\nThrough practical class in school, students are able to acquire the way of effective communication with others. It allows them to state their own idea to classmates logically and discuss a variety of issues such as global warming which is one of the debatable themes. In addition, this practical skill takes positive effects on their work in the future because employees must make decisions with colleagues to deal with any kinds of problems in a workplace. Therefore, students should get this skill in the school.\nImproving their practical skills also help affect an understanding with people from all over the world positively. Individuals are needed to accept the differences of each other even people who have other country and culture in this 21st century. This is because the skill plays an important role in making a creative community and it is often believed that people who have a high level of literacy of the differences help create great services and applications which anyone could not imagine. Hence, having this practical skills is an important for students practically.\nFinally, enhancing the practical capability has positive effects on even their an overall quality of life. According to a reputable report in the university of the United States, people who have the ability of high communication skill with team members in the office have a tendency to feel happiness in their life compared to people who do not have it. Considered to the well-being of students in total life span, polishing this ability is an significant way to increase the number of people who spend their lives in abundance. Overall, all students should learn the practical skills in the school.\nIn conclusion, there might be opposite ideas that students should study academics in the school. From the way they can have an effective communication to the ways they can understand accept each other, they can heighten their an overall quality of life, students must learn practical skills such as teamwork and problem-solving.","output":"I made several corrections to your essay to help you reach the C1 level of the CEFR:\n\n* It can be argued that it is more important for schools to focus on practical skills such as teamwork and problem-solving, as they are essential for effective communication, an understanding of cultural differences, and overall quality of life.\n* Through practical classes in school, students can develop their communication skills and learn how to express their ideas logically and participate in discussions on complex issues, such as global warming. This skill is also valuable in the workplace, where employees must work together to resolve problems.\n* Improving practical skills also helps foster an understanding of people from diverse backgrounds, which is crucial in today's globalized world. People with a high level of cultural literacy are often creative and capable of creating innovative products and services that are in demand. Hence, these skills are practical and important for students to learn.\n* Furthermore, enhancing practical skills has a positive impact on one's overall quality of life. A study at a university in the United States found that people with strong teamwork skills are more likely to experience happiness in their lives compared to those who do not have them.

Investigations such as diagnostic imaging, ultrasonography, skin examination and blood tests are conducted for initial staging and also as a part of a follow-up program after definitive surgical treatment. Sentinel node biopsy, is also undertaken for staging and prognostic purposes, however for discussion of this procedure we refer readers to the specific guideline for use of sentinel node biopsy in staging cutaneous melanoma.\n\nThe main purpose of follow-up is to detect recurrences early so that early treatment can be undertaken. This assumes that earlier treatment is likely to result in improvements in regional disease control, quality of life and survival. Therefore, follow-up should be mainly prognosis-oriented but should also include the detection of new invasive melanomas. The reported incidence of new primaries ranges from >0.5% to 5% annually dependent on risk features.[1][2] A second invasive melanoma is most commonly thinner than the initial primary melanoma and has a more favourable prognosis that does not adversely affect survival.[3] The rate of occurrence of a subsequent in-situ melanoma is about four times higher than the risk of a subsequent invasive melanoma[4], but most series do not recommend follow-up for in-situ melanomas.[5]\n\nAfter systematic review of the literature (2012-2016) including previous melanoma guidelines, we considered the evidence base for the use of diagnostic tests for initial staging and follow-up. NHMRC levels of evidence (I-IV) were assigned to each evidence summary statement and recommendations were formed and graded with regard to consistency, clinical impact, generalisability, and applicability for the Australian context. Investigations reviewed in this chapter include chest x-ray, computed tomography (CT) imaging, positron emission tomography (PET)\/CT imaging, ultrasonography, and S 100B, MIA, LDH blood tests. Additional experimental investigations identified through our systematic search, are discussed in the section for further research.\n\nThe evidence below is a summary of the key findings of test accuracy and clinical usefulness for each diagnostic investigation. We report sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive values where available as the main test performance characteristics for the index test compared to the referent (gold) standard. For follow-up, the proportion resulting in a change in management and\/or a change in morbidity and mortality are presented if known. The evidence and recommendations for optimal follow-up settings, duration and frequency are discussed in a separate chapter (see following section)\n\nNearly all studies for initial staging and follow-up were retrospective in design, at high risk of bias and of NHMRC level III or IV (lower quality) evidence. Several follow-up studies grouped stage II and III patients making ascertainment of benefits or harms from diagnostic investigations difficult. All included results are for stage I\/II patients unless otherwise indicated.\n\nInvestigations for stage I and stage II melanoma in patients with a negative sentinel node\nImaging\nChest x-ray (CXR) for initial staging\nThere was only one new study published since 2012. This retrospective study investigated use of pre-operative imaging for 546 clinically node negative cutaneous melanoma patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy. In total 409\/546 (75%) had an imaging study: 383 (70%)had a CXR, 53 had CT scans (10%; included 43 CT chest, 34 CT abdomen\/pelvis, 2 CT head, 4 CT neck), 25 PET scans (5%), 20 MRI scans (4%; included 18 head MRI, 1 extremity MRI and 1 spine MRI), and 2 people had extremity X-rays (0.4%).[6] Of the 383 people who had CXR, three had positive findings, all of which were false positives (all had negative chest CT scans; false positive rate 0.8%, true positive rate 0%). The 380 negative results were all true negatives. Pre-operative imaging for detection of metastases was not recommended.\n\nGiven the limited number of new studies on CXR, a review of the recommendations from previous guidelines was warranted.[3] Among 17 studies, CXR detected stage IV metastatic disease in a few patients; however the test results did not change clinical management, and did not improve overall survival. CXR had a false positive rate of between 2-71%, and a true positive rate of 0%.[7] The evidence base for guidance on use of CXR consisted of small observational studies, with no RCTs, with medium to high risk of bias (NHMRC level of evidence III-2 to IV).\n\nChest x-ray (CXR) during follow-up\nThe use of routine chest X-ray exams for the detection of small pulmonary metastases has been investigated. However, false-positive and false-negative findings are frequent. The sensitivity of chest X-ray is poor with reports varying from 7.7% to 48%. A large study of 1969 patients with stage I-III melanoma undergoing routine follow up found that only 10\/204 relapses were discovered by chest X-ray: the majority (7\/10) of which were observed in patients with stage III disease.[8] A large prospective study of 1 235 patients found that only 0.9% of chest X-rays identified pulmonary metastases, less than 10% of which were amenable to resection, with a false positive rate of 3.1%.[9] A cost-effectiveness analysis using data from the Roswell Park Cancer Institute and the National Cancer Institute\u2019s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program found that the cost of CXR screening per quality-adjusted life year was $165,000, respectively, in 1996 US dollars.[10] Based on these findings, the investigators suggested reducing the frequency of screening CXR.\n\nComputed tomography (CT) imaging for initial staging\nOne retrospective study of 172 patients with clinically stage IIB or IIC melanoma evaluated the use of CT of the head, chest, abdomen and pelvis for initial staging.[11] In total 75 patients had 104 CT scans for initial staging, with 8 positive results, of which 6 were false positives and two true positives in one patient with metastatic disease, and one patient with a secondary non-melanoma cancer.\n\nComputed tomography (CT) imaging during follow-up\nNo new studies of CT surveillance of asymptomatic patients treated for stage I\/II melanoma were identified. Existing guidelines and prior studies report little benefit in terms of early detection of metastatic disease, a change in clinical management, improved survival, or cost-effectiveness.[12][13]\n\nPositron emission tomography (PET) or computed tomography (PET\/CT) imaging for initial staging\nOne retrospective study among 106 patients with head and neck primary melanoma, clinically negative nodal disease and negative CT, evaluated the use of FDG-PET for initial staging.[14] In total 47 patients had FDG-PET, with 10 positive results, of which 8 were false positives and two true positives in patients with secondary non-melanoma cancers. Of the 37 patients with a negative FDG-PET, 33 results were true negatives and four were false negatives in patients with occult nodal disease. FDG-PET was found to have no clinical utility in this patient population.[14]\n\nFive new studies using PET\/CT were identified, including one systematic review[15], two primary studies assessing detection of nodal disease[16][17] and four assessing detection of distant metastases.[15][17][18][19] In one retrospective study of 149 patients undergoing pre-operative PET\/CT imaging for clinically stage I\/II melanoma of at least 1 mm thickness, 41 had positive findings, 35 were false positives and 6 were true positives (metastatic involvement of lymph node confirmed histologically; false positive rate 85%, true positive rate 15%).[18] There was no clinical utility associated with PET\/CT above and beyond SNB: false positives led to unnecessary invasive procedures, and true positives yielded no further information to the SNB. The authors concluded pre-operative PET\/CT was of limited benefit in staging clinical stage I\/II patients.[18] Another study compared sensitivity and specificity of PET\/CT versus high resolution ultrasound for the identification of metastatic involvement of sentinel lymph node.[16] The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of PET\/CT were 0%, 100% (95%CI 91.6\u2013100.0), 0% and 71.1% (95% CI 58.6\u201381.2) respectively. The authors concluded high resolution ultrasound was better value than PET\/CT in preoperative identification of positive SLNs. A second retrospective study of 77 clinically stage I\/II melanoma patients aimed to identify a threshold thickness for the primary melanoma, above which PET\/CT might be useful.[19] All but 1 of the 11 patients with positive PET\/CT findings had melanomas \u22655mm (only 5 positive PET\/CT results were confirmed true positives histologically: 4 lymph node metastases, 1 distant metastasis). Four of the 11 patients with positive PET\/CT (36%), and 5 of 66 patients with negative PET\/CT (8%), died from melanoma. It was unclear whether the PET\/CT results influenced clinical management.[19]\n\nIn general, against a histopathology reference standard PET\/CT generally had moderate to low sensitivity and higher specificity. High false positive rates including detection of benign lesions and other cancers led to additional investigations including invasive procedures.[15][18] Some melanoma metastases were missed on PET\/CT being detected clinically within 6 months of the index scan,[17] or detected with SNB.[14]\n\nPositron emission tomography (PET) or computed tomography (PET\/CT) imaging during follow up\nA recent systematic review by Danielson et al[20] of 7 studies was undertaken to assess the diagnostic value of PET as a tool for surveillance in the regular follow-up program of asymptomatic cutaneous malignant melanoma patients. The majority of the 739 patients in the studies were stage IIB and III. The authors concluded that the mean sensitivity of PET was 96% (95% CI: 92-98) and the specificity was 92% (95% CI: 87-95). Overall, PET has a high diagnostic value. However, there were no data available to demonstrate better survival outcomes for patients as a result of routine PET surveillance.[20]\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for initial staging\nThe retrospective study of 546 patients discussed above under CXR also included MRI scans used for initial staging in 20 patients (4%; included 18 head MRI, 1 extremity MRI and 1 spine MRI).[6] The one positive MRI test result was a false positive in a patient with a benign thyroid nodule. The 19 negative results were all true negatives.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for during follow-up\nCerebral metastases are more readily detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) than by CT or FDG-PET\/CT.[21], however no new studies published since 2012 of MRI follow-up of stage I\/II patients were identified.","output":"Slide 1: Introduction\n---------------------\n\nTranscript:\nWelcome to our course on investigations and follow-up for patients with clinical stage I\/II melanoma. We will discuss various diagnostic tests, their accuracy, and clinical usefulness in detecting early metastatic disease in regional lymph nodes (stage III) or distant organs (stage IV). The primary objective of follow-up is early detection of recurrences, leading to improved regional disease control, quality of life, and survival.\n\nSlide 2: Methods\n----------------\n\nTranscript:\nOur course is based on a systematic review of the literature from 2012 to 2016, including previous melanoma guidelines. We have assigned NHMRC levels of evidence to each evidence summary statement and formed recommendations specific to the Australian context. The investigations reviewed include chest x-ray, computed tomography (CT) imaging, positron emission tomography (PET)\/CT imaging, ultrasonography, and blood tests.\n\nSlide 3: Imaging for Stage I\/II Melanoma\n----------------------------------------\n\nTranscript:\nWe will discuss the use of chest x-ray (CXR), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET)\/CT, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for initial staging and follow-up in patients with stage I\/II melanoma.\n\nSlide 4: Chest X-ray (CXR)\n--------------------------\n\nTranscript:\nFor initial staging, CXR has limited clinical utility and is not recommended due to high false positive rates and no improvement in overall survival. During follow-up, CXR has poor sensitivity, and its use for detecting small pulmonary metastases is not cost-effective.\n\nSlide 5: Computed Tomography (CT) Imaging\n-----------------------------------------\n\nTranscript:\nFor initial staging, CT imaging has limited clinical utility and is not recommended for asymptomatic patients with stage I\/II melanoma.

During follow-up, PET has a high diagnostic value but lacks data demonstrating better survival outcomes for patients as a result of routine surveillance.\n\nSlide 7: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\n-----------------------------------------\n\nTranscript:\nFor initial staging, MRI has limited clinical utility and is not recommended for routine use in stage I\/II melanoma patients. For follow-up, cerebral metastases are more readily detected by MRI than by CT or FDG-PET\/CT; however, no new studies published since 2012 of MRI follow-up of stage I\/II patients were identified.\n\nSlide 8: Conclusion\n-------------------\n\nTranscript:\nIn conclusion, the main goal of investigations and follow-up for patients with clinical stage I\/II melanoma is early detection of recurrences to improve treatment outcomes. However, many imaging modalities have limited clinical utility in initial staging and follow-up, and their use should be carefully considered based on the individual patient's risk factors and clinical context."}

When a `yield from` expression is encountered in a generator, the generator will delegate its operation to the iterable specified in the expression.\n\nIn the example provided, the behavior difference is caused by the `next(iter(a))` statement. When using `Class1`, the generator `(i for i in range(3))` is iterated over during the first call to `next(iter(a))`, and the generator's state is not saved.

Here are some key events and influences that shaped the development of the English language:\n\n1. Old English (c. 450-1100): The earliest form of the English language, Old English was spoken in England by Germanic tribes such as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. It was heavily influenced by Latin and other languages spoken in the British Isles at the time.\n2. Middle English (c. 1100-1500): Middle English emerged after the Norman Conquest of 1066 when French-speaking Normans conquered England. This led to a significant influence of French on the English language, as well as the adoption of the Latin alphabet.\n3. Early Modern English (c. 1500-1800): Early Modern English began with the Great Vowel Shift, a series of changes in pronunciation that altered the sound of many English vowels. During this time, English also saw significant expansion through colonization and trade, which brought new words and phrases from other languages.\n4. Late Modern English (c. 1800-Present): Late Modern English is characterized by the standardization of English spelling and grammar, the rise of the British Empire, and the influence of American English. In the 20th century, English became a global language with the spread of British and American culture, media, and technology.\n\nThroughout its history, English has also been influenced by various other languages, including Norse, Celtic, and Greek. The evolution of English is a complex process that continues to this day, with new words and phrases being added to the language all the time."}

{"instruction":"","input":"act as a harvard business graduate: Answer these questions in essay form with long detailed answer based on this information: Chapter 2 discussion-Trade and Investment Policies. O1. Discuss the vale af voluntary export restraints in international business. 2. What is meant by multilateral negotiations? 3. Discuss the impact of import restrictions on consumers. 4. Discuss the barriers exporters usually face and state how they are affected by these barriers.","output":"1. Voluntary export restraints (VERs) are agreements between exporting and importing countries where the exporting country agrees to limit its exports to a specified level. These restrictions are often imposed as a result of pressure from the importing country, which may threaten to impose more severe import restrictions in the absence of a VER.\n\nThe value of VERs in international business is a highly debated topic. Proponents argue that VERs can be beneficial in protecting domestic industries from foreign competition, preserving jobs and industries, and promoting fair trade practices. For example, a VER could allow a domestic industry to compete with foreign companies while still maintaining some level of protection from excessive foreign competition.\n\nHowever, critics argue that VERs can lead to higher prices for consumers and reduced competition in the marketplace. Domestic industries may become complacent and fail to innovate, as they are shielded from competition. VERs can also result in retaliation from the exporting country, which could lead to a trade war and have negative effects on both countries' economies.\n\n2. Multilateral negotiations refer to negotiations that involve multiple countries and aim to reach a consensus or agreement on a particular issue. These negotiations can occur in the context of international trade agreements, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), where member countries come together to negotiate rules and regulations for international trade.\n\nMultilateral negotiations are important in international business as they provide a platform for countries to discuss and address trade-related issues, such as tariffs, subsidies, and intellectual property rights. These negotiations can also help to promote cooperation and understanding among countries, which can lead to more stable and predictable trade relationships.\n\n3. Import restrictions can have a significant impact on consumers. When a country imposes import restrictions, it limits the variety of goods available to consumers and can lead to higher prices. This can be particularly problematic for low-income households, who may struggle to afford basic necessities if prices increase.\n\nImport restrictions can also have negative effects on businesses that rely on imports for their operations. These businesses may face higher costs and reduced access to necessary inputs, which can lead to reduced productivity and profitability.\n\n4. Exporters often face various barriers when attempting to access foreign markets. These barriers can take many forms, including tariffs, quotas, technical regulations, and customs procedures.\n\nTariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods, which can increase the cost of exports and make them less competitive in foreign markets. Quotas are limits on the quantity of a particular product that can be imported, which can restrict the amount of goods that exporters can sell in a given market. Technical regulations can be difficult for exporters to navigate, as they often require specific certifications or product testing. Customs procedures, such as lengthy clearance times or documentation requirements, can also create barriers for exporters.\n\nThese barriers can have significant negative effects on exporters, including reduced profits and decreased market access. Exporters may also face challenges in adapting their products or processes to meet the specific regulations of foreign markets, which can be time-consuming and costly. However, some exporters may also see these barriers as an opportunity to innovate and develop new products or processes that can better meet the needs of foreign markets."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Hey, please write a code for me for the Rasa framework of chatbot","output":"Sure, I can help you with that! Here's an example code for a simple chatbot using Rasa framework:\n\n1. First, you need to install Rasa framework by running the following command in your terminal:\n```\npip install rasa\n```\n1. Once you've installed Rasa, you can create a new project by running the following command:\n```csharp\nrasa init\n```\n1. This will create a new directory called `my_chatbot` with the basic structure for a Rasa project.\n2. The next step is to define your chatbot's domain. This includes information such as the chatbot's name, the intents it can handle, the entities it can extract, and the actions it can perform. You can define your domain in a file called `domain.yml`.\n3. Here's an example `domain.yml` file for a chatbot that can handle two intents: \"greet\" and \"goodbye\":\n```vbnet\nintents:\n  - greet\n  - goodbye\n\nresponses:\n  utter_greet:\n  - text: \"Hello! How can I assist you today?\"\n\n  utter_goodbye:\n  - text: \"Goodbye! Have a nice day.\"\n\nactions:\n  - utter_greet\n  - utter_goodbye\n```\n1. Next, you need to create some training data to teach your chatbot how to handle these intents. You can create a file called `data.yml` and define some examples of user messages and the corresponding intents:\n```markdown\nversion: \"2.0\"\n\nnlu:\n- intent: greet\n  examples: |\n    - hi\n    - hello\n    - hey there\n\n- intent: goodbye\n  examples: |\n    - bye\n    - goodbye\n    - see you later\n```\n1. Once you have your domain and training data defined, you can train your chatbot by running the following command:\n```\nrasa train\n```\n1. After training, you can test your chatbot by running the following command:\n```\nrasa shell\n```\n1. You can then enter messages to see how your chatbot responds. For example, if you enter \"hi\", your chatbot should respond with \"Hello! How can I assist you today?\".\n\nThat's it! This is a simple example of how to build a chatbot using Rasa framework. You can add more intents, entities, and actions to make your chatbot more sophisticated and capable."}

Confidence is an essential trait for any speaker looking to make a positive impact on their audience, but what is the reason behind the high self-esteem of successful speakers? In this article, we will explore the factors that contribute to a speaker's confidence and offer practical advice for those looking to improve their speaking skills.\n\nOne of the main reasons that successful speakers exude confidence is their preparation. They understand that the key to delivering an effective presentation is thorough preparation. Successful speakers invest a great deal of time and effort into researching their topic, organizing their thoughts, and practicing their delivery. They rehearse their presentation until they can deliver it with ease, which gives them a sense of control over the situation. This level of preparation also helps to alleviate any anxiety that they may feel about speaking in public, which can be a major hurdle for many people.\n\nAnother factor that contributes to a speaker's confidence is their ability to connect with their audience. Successful speakers understand that it is not just about delivering information, but also about engaging their audience and creating a connection with them. They use body language, eye contact, and vocal variety to build rapport with their audience and keep them engaged. This connection with their audience helps them to feel more comfortable and confident on stage.\n\nSuccessful speakers also understand the power of storytelling. They know that stories are an effective way to capture the attention of their audience and convey their message in a memorable way. By sharing personal anecdotes or real-life examples, they are able to make their presentation more relatable and engaging for their audience. This skill not only helps to build their confidence but also makes their message more impactful.\n\nIn addition to these factors, successful speakers also have a positive mindset. They believe in themselves and their abilities, which gives them the confidence to take risks and push themselves outside of their comfort zone. They also view mistakes and failures as opportunities for growth rather than as reasons to give up. This positive mindset helps them to bounce back from setbacks and maintain their confidence in the face of challenges.\n\nIf you are looking to improve your own speaking skills and build your confidence as a speaker, there are several practical steps you can take. Firstly, invest time in preparing your presentation thoroughly. Research your topic, organize your thoughts, and practice your delivery until you feel confident and comfortable. Secondly, work on building a connection with your audience. Use body language, eye contact, and vocal variety to engage your audience and build rapport with them. Thirdly, incorporate storytelling into your presentations. Use personal anecdotes or real-life examples to make your message more relatable and memorable. Lastly, cultivate a positive mindset. Believe in yourself and your abilities, view mistakes and failures as opportunities for growth, and maintain your confidence in the face of challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, the reason behind the high self-esteem of successful speakers is a combination of thorough preparation, the ability to connect with their audience, the power of storytelling, and a positive mindset. By implementing these factors into your own speaking style, you can build your confidence and become a more effective and impactful speaker. With practice and persistence, you too can master the art of public speaking and make a positive impact on your audience."}

{"instruction":"","input":"what does slantchev means on his paper entitled state and anarchy when he says: The Genesis of the Modern State System\nWhere do the modern states come from? Tradition dates the creation of the\nmodern state system with the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. This treaty ended\nthe Thirty Years War, which was actually a series of wars over religious,\nterritorial, dynastic, and commercial issues. It started when the Catholic king\nof Bohemia Ferdinand II attempted to impose his religion on his Protestant\nnobles. Soon Denmark and Sweden got involved, along with Poland and Russia.\nIn the end, the main alliances solidified around religious lines, pitting the\nCatholic Holy Roman Empire ruled by the Habsburg dynasty, against a group\nof Protestant towns and territories aided by Sweden and Netherlands. Waged\nmostly in German territories, the war was grievously costly and the devastation\n\u2013 immense.\nThe treaty distributed territories (mostly to Sweden, France, and their allies)\nand confirmed the sovereignty over them. It also confirmed or extended\nreligious toleration to Lutherans and Calvinists within the Holy Roman Empire.\nIn Germany, central authority was replaced by sovereignty of about 300\nprinces and the weak confederation persisted until the unification more than\nthree centuries later.\nThere have been many other wars and treaties before the Peace of Westphalia.\nThere have been many other large-scale political organizations before that as\nwell. Why do we privilege 1648 then? Because Westphalia marked the\ntransition from a system of overlapping feudal loyalties toward a system\nincorporating the principle of sovereignty. Sovereignty refers to the principle\nof complete authority within a territory. That is, it provides for an entity that\ncommands the loyalty of its subjects. This entity was called the state, an\nabstract notion that referred to the legal standing of the ruler.\nPrior to 1648, Britain and France looked like sovereign states because they\nboth had kings who wielded power within their territories. But the situation in\nthe rest of Europe was quite different. After the fall of the Roman empire,\npolitical entities were local, organized along feudal lines, and with little or no\ninteraction among themselves. The Catholic Holy Roman Empire formally\nencompassed almost all of Central Europe but its ruler did not have\nsovereignty over its various members: by the 1555 Peace of Augsburg, local\nGerman princes could impose their own religion within their territories. The\nsystem was unstable because of conflicting claims of authority over the same\nterritories and their inhabitants. It was this that led to the Thirty Years War.\nThe Westphalian system enshrined the state as the sole form of authority in\nEurope that neither the Holy Roman Empire nor the Pope could challenge (which explains why Pope Innocent X blasted the treaties as \u201cnull, void, invalid,\niniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect\nfor all time.\u201d) The local rulers could freely align diplomatically with whoever\nthey wished, they could organize they commerce and trade as they saw fit.\nAlthough intervention did not cease, the treaty brought to an end the\nintervention based on religious matters, removing what had been the prime\ncause of war in Europe for the preceding two centuries. Before discussing\nsovereignty in some detail, it is worth taking a look at the movement toward a\nnation-state. That is, a state that encompasses a nation","output":"In his paper entitled \"State and Anarchy,\" Slantchev argues that the modern state system can be traced back to the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. This treaty marked the transition from a system of overlapping feudal loyalties to a system incorporating the principle of sovereignty, where an entity (the state) commands the loyalty of its subjects within a defined territory. Prior to 1648, political entities in Europe were local and organized along feudal lines, with little interaction among themselves. The Thirty Years War, sparked by religious conflicts, led to the Westphalian system, which established the state as the sole form of authority in Europe and removed religious intervention as a cause of war. The treaty also allowed local rulers to align diplomatically with whoever they wished and to organize trade and commerce as they saw fit. The movement towards a nation-state, where a state encompasses a nation, is also discussed in the paper."}

{"instruction":"","input":"react error when received results from php api, message is 'A component is changing a controlled input to be uncontrolled.'","output":"This error message in React usually means that you have a controlled component (an input element that is bound to state using the `value` prop) that is being set to an undefined value.\n\nThere are a few possible causes for this error. One common scenario is that you are receiving results from a PHP API and trying to use those results to set the value of a controlled input. If the API response is not in the format you expect, it can cause the input value to be set to `undefined`, which triggers the error.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to ensure that the API response is in the expected format before using it to set the input value. You can use conditional statements to check if the response is valid before setting the state that is used to control the input value.\n\nHere is an example code snippet that shows how you can handle this error:\n```jsx\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport axios from 'axios';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    async function fetchData() {\n      try {\n        const response = await axios.get('url-to-php-api');\n        if (response.data && response.data.inputValue) {\n          setInputValue(response.data.inputValue);\n        }\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error(error);\n      }\n    }\n\n    fetchData();\n  }, []);\n\n  function handleInputChange(event) {\n    setInputValue(event.target.value);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <input type=\"text\" value={inputValue} onChange={handleInputChange} \/>\n  );\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `useEffect` hook fetches data from a PHP API and sets the `inputValue` state using the `setInputValue` function. Before setting the state, it checks if the API response is valid and contains the expected value for `inputValue`.\n\nIf you still have trouble fixing this error, please provide more details about your code and the API response, and I'll try to help you further."}

{"instruction":"","input":"i have text \"% shadowToCatarin: tp\" and \"%shadowToCatarin: tp\" can you write rejex which can parse \"shadowToCatarin\" text, and rejex should match both this situation?","output":"Yes, you can use the following regular expression to match \"shadowToCatarin\" in both situations:\n```ruby\n%(?:<\\w+>\\s+)?(\\w+)\n```\nHere's a breakdown of how the regular expression works:\n\n* `%` matches the percent sign at the beginning of the string.\n* `(?:<\\w+>\\s+)?` is a non-capturing group that matches an optional sequence of \"<word>\" followed by one or more whitespace characters. The `(?:)` syntax creates a group that is not captured (i.e., it won't be included in the output of the match). The `\\w+` matches one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores), and the `\\s+` matches one or more whitespace characters.\n* `(\\w+)` is a capturing group that matches one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores). This is the text that you want to extract.\n\nHere's an example in Python:\n```python\nimport re\n\ntext1 = \"%<MYDAK> shadowToCatarin: tp\"\ntext2 = \"%shadowToCatarin: tp\"\n\npattern = r\"%(?:<\\w+>\\s+)?(\\w+)\"\n\nmatch1 = re.search(pattern, text1)\nif match1:\n    print(match1.group(1))  # Output: shadowToCatarin\n\nmatch2 = re.search(pattern, text2)\nif match2:\n    print(match2.group(1))  # Output: shadowToCatarin\n```\nNote that the `re.search` function returns a match object if there is a match, and `match.group(1)` returns the text that is captured by the first capturing group in the regular expression (i.e., the text matched by `(\\w+)`)."}

{"instruction":"","input":"come up with 3 ideas how to make chess a more fun game by mixing it with the battle royale genre","output":"Sure, here are three possible ideas for how to mix chess with the battle royale genre to make the game more exciting:\n\n1. Chess Royale: In this version of the game, each player starts with a small army of pawns and one piece of their choice, such as a knight or bishop. As they capture their opponent's pieces, they can add them to their own army, gradually building a more powerful force. The goal is to be the last player standing with a full set of pieces. To add an element of randomness and surprise, certain squares on the board could be designated as \"supply drops\" that contain powerful pieces or other bonuses.\n2. Chess Battle Arena: This version of the game takes place on a larger board with multiple players, with the goal of being the last player standing. Each player starts in a corner of the board with a small army of pawns and a queen. As players capture pieces, they earn points that can be used to upgrade their own army or launch attacks against their opponents. Players can also earn bonuses by controlling certain squares or zones on the board, creating opportunities for strategic maneuvering and surprise attacks.\n3. Chess Blitz Royale: This version of the game combines the fast-paced gameplay of blitz chess with the intensity of battle royale. Each player has a limited amount of time to make their moves, and the game ends when only one player is left on the board. To make things even more challenging, the board could be set up with obstacles or traps that players need to navigate around while trying to outmaneuver their opponents. This version of the game would be perfect for players who enjoy quick thinking and fast reflexes."}

{"instruction":"","input":"When describing exit egress capacity on a door should it be referred as allowed or provided?","output":"When describing the exit egress capacity on a door, it is more appropriate to use the term \"provided\" rather than \"allowed\". This is because \"provided\" more accurately reflects the physical capabilities of the door and the surrounding environment, whereas \"allowed\" implies a more subjective assessment of whether the exit egress capacity is adequate or not.\n\nFor example, you might say \"The door provides an exit egress capacity of 60 people per minute,\" which simply describes the physical capability of the door to allow people to exit at a certain rate. On the other hand, if you say \"The door allows for an exit egress capacity of 60 people per minute,\" it implies that the door is suitable for allowing that many people to exit safely in an emergency, which may depend on other factors such as the size of the room, the number of people present, and the presence of any hazards.\n\nSo, in general, it's more accurate to use the term \"provided\" when describing the exit egress capacity of a door."}
{"instruction":"","input":"Explain the Akaike information criterion and in which context is useful?","output":"The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is a measure of the relative quality of a statistical model for a given set of data. It is based on the likelihood function and takes into account the complexity of the model and the amount of data used to fit the model. The AIC is defined as 2k - 2ln(L), where k is the number of parameters in the model and L is the maximum value of the likelihood function for the model.\n\nAIC can be used to compare different models and select the best one for a given dataset. It is particularly useful in situations where the number of observations is less than the number of parameters in the model. In such cases, overfitting is a concern, and AIC can be used to identify models that strike a balance between fitting the data well and being relatively simple.\n\nAIC is widely used in various fields such as econometrics, bioinformatics, and signal processing. It is also used as a model selection criteria in machine learning, particularly in model selection for time series analysis, survival analysis, and other fields."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Write a fictional story about what the world would have looked like today if the Treaty of Breda (July 31, 1667) between the English and the Dutch would not have happened. maximum 500 words","output":"In an alternate reality where the Treaty of Breda never happened, the world we know today would be vastly different. The conflict between the English and the Dutch would have continued, and escalated, leading to widespread devastation and lasting consequences.\n\nWithout the treaty, the Second Anglo-Dutch War would have continued, with both sides engaging in brutal naval battles and land skirmishes. The Dutch would have continued their successful raids on English trade routes, cutting off vital supplies and resources. The English, determined to assert their dominance, would have retaliated with force, leading to the destruction of Dutch colonies and cities in the Americas and Asia.\n\nAs the war dragged on, other European powers would have been drawn into the conflict. France, eager to weaken their longtime rival England, would have allied with the Dutch, while the Holy Roman Empire and Spain would have supported the English. The resulting conflict would have been a full-blown European war, with armies clashing on battlefields from the Netherlands to Italy.\n\nThe war would have had disastrous consequences for both sides. The Dutch, already struggling with economic and political instability, would have been pushed to the brink of collapse. Their colonies in the Americas and Asia would have been lost, and their navy and merchant fleet would have been severely weakened. The English, too, would have suffered heavy losses, with their economy and military strength severely impacted.\n\nThe impact of the war would have been felt far beyond Europe. Without the Treaty of Breda, the English and Dutch would not have formed their alliance, and the balance of power in Europe would have shifted. France would have emerged as the dominant power, with their victory in the war leading to a period of expansion and colonization. The world would have looked very different, with France controlling much of North America and the Caribbean, and dominating the global trade routes.\n\nThe impact of this alternate history would still be felt today. The English language, which spread through colonization and trade in our timeline, would not have had the same influence, and the dominant language of global commerce may have been French. The geopolitical landscape of the world would have been vastly different, with France as the dominant world power, and the United States and the United Kingdom playing a much smaller role.\n\nIn conclusion, the failure of the Treaty of Breda to come into being would have had a profound impact on world history. The Second Anglo-Dutch War would have escalated into a full-blown European conflict, leading to the downfall of the Dutch and the rise of France as the dominant world power. The world as we know it today would be unrecognizable, with a vastly different geopolitical landscape and a different dominant language."}

First, the development team must design the user interface using React.js and Next.js, which allows for the creation of responsive and dynamic web applications. Next, the team must write the smart contracts that will govern the behavior of the EHR system using Solidity, a programming language specifically designed for Ethereum. The smart contracts are then deployed onto the Ethereum blockchain, which ensures their transparency and immutability. The EHR data is stored on IPFS, a decentralized storage platform that ensures the privacy and security of patient data. Finally, web3 is used to connect the front-end user interface with the back-end smart contracts, allowing for seamless interaction between the two. Overall, this approach allows for the creation of a secure, decentralized, and transparent EHR management system that puts patient privacy and security at the forefront."}

Knowing and sensing what we feel, even if we don\u2019t yet understand those feelings, will deactivate our habitual actions, leading to more effective responsiveness. \nStep nine: If you are working with a depressed patient who is not getting better, analyze each statement you make for a five-minute video passage. Count the number of sentences you do the following: 1) invite feelings; 2) regulate anxiety; 3) point out a defense, and 4) cognizing. When depressed patients are not improving, often therapists cognize and point out defenses far more than inviting feelings. See if you can increase the number of times you invite the patient to face her feelings and decrease the number of times you talk about defenses and cognize. See what happens if you can encourage your patient to do something helpful (\u201cwould like to take a look at this? Could we take a look at this feeling so we can help you overcome this depression? Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to know what you feel so you wouldn\u2019t have to have these symptoms instead? Shall we take a look at this feeling?\u201d) between 3 and 9 times per minute. \nThis increased dose of encouragement and decreased dose of discouragement (pointing out defenses---what she does wrong) should help to move the therapy forward. Remember: there is only one reason to point out a defense---to help the patient do something healthy instead, like facing her feelings. \nStep ten: often we get stuck, arguing with the patient, or more subtly asking the patient not to do what he or she is doing. That is, we are resisting the patient\u2019s resistance. And when we resist the patient\u2019s resistance, we reinforce it. What to do? Watch your video and each time the patient says something on the video, say out loud to the video, \u201cI can accept this.\u201d \nAs you keep doing this, you will become more aware of what you are not accepting. You will become more aware of your resistance and the way you are reinforcing the patient\u2019s resistance. \nGo through the entire video, continually saying, \u201cI can accept this.\u201d Notice how to begin to accept the patient (meaning, reality). If you are still not accepting the patient, watch the video again, and this time each time the patient speaks, say out loud, \u201cI don\u2019t want to accept you as you are in this moment.\u201d The next step is to make a list of what you cannot accept in the patient. Now find three ways that each of these things is true about you. And find three ways that you reject these aspects of yourself. Once you regain the capacity to accept yourself on a deeper level, you will be able to accept your patients\u2019 resistance on a deeper level, and your resistance will dissolve.","output":"In summary, the steps to analyze a therapy session using video are:\n\n1. Transcribe the video and analyze each patient statement as a stimulus, expression of feeling, example of excessive anxiety, or defense.\n2. Analyze your interventions, focusing on whether you asked for feelings, regulated anxiety, or addressed defenses.\n3. Compare the patient's responses and your interventions to see if your intervention addressed the patient's response and need.\n4. Make a list of the patient's defenses and identify the most common one, the \"pillar defense,\" to focus on in the next session.\n5. Watch the video again with the sound off and look for sighs as a sign of unconscious anxiety, indicating effective interventions.\n6. If the patient is not responding or making progress, consider if the patient is an involuntary referral, ambivalent, or has organic or brain factors affecting the therapy.\n7. Notice shifts in your own feelings and sensations during the therapy session and practice bearing them to improve responsiveness.\n8. Increase the number of times you invite the patient to face feelings and decrease the number of times you talk about defenses and cognize if working with a depressed patient.\n9. Recognize when you are resisting the patient's resistance and practice saying \"I can accept this\" to increase acceptance of the patient and decrease resistance.\n10. Make a list of what you cannot accept in the patient and find three ways that those things are true about yourself and three ways that you reject those aspects of yourself to improve acceptance of the patient."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Princess Jaedala\nDaughter of the recently deceased Empress Lakshmi, Princess Jaedala is the heir to the throne of the Luxian Empire and is due to have her coronation soon. She is deeply insecure about her leadership abilities, especially in her mother\u2019s shadow. However, she does a very good job of not showing that side of herself in public. As far the Empire knows, she\u2019s a very confident woman who knows exactly what she\u2019s doing and is a capable leader. In reality, she usually does what seems to be the right thing in any given moment and deals with consequences as they come. She both loves and respects her mother, who trained her from infancy to be the next empress, and hopes she can make her mother proud.\n\nJaedala stands about 6.5 feet tall and has lavender skin and dark red eyes. Her hair is a deep, rich shade of purple and falls almost to her knees. She is fit, and usually spends a while having her hair and makeup done. She is very beautiful by Luxian standards.\n\nIn public, she typically dresses in Luxian formalwear or a more professional version of the sari-like robe, depending on the occasion. In private, she wears slightly more comfortable sari-like robes, though still very fancy.\nParvati\nParvati is an on-again, off-again Luxite friend of Princess Jaedala who is employed in the palace as an alien slave trainer. Aliens who will be serving royalty directly need extra training - royal etiquette, how to address their masters, safety, etc. - which Parvati is tasked with providing. She is a very kind, compassionate woman who knows when she needs to be firm, but usually prefers to \u201ckill them with kindness\u201d. She is not in favor of the Luxian practice of enslaving aliens, but she sees her job as an alien trainer as a way to ensure that her charges are treated fairly and lead a comfortable life. Her methods are very effective - not only has she trained virtually every enslaved alien in the Luxian palace, but they all know her by name and continue to show her respect and friendship. Princess Jaedala doesn\u2019t really approve of Parvati\u2019s \u201csoft\u201d approach, but she can\u2019t deny the results.\n\nWhen Jaedala hired Parvati, she presented Parvati with several welcoming gifts. Among them was a newly purchased alien slave named Shiro. Parvati was uncomfortable with this as she had purposely never bought a slave herself, but decided to keep Shiro because she didn\u2019t want him to end up with a master who would mistreat him. She\u2019s also grateful for his help cooking for her and keeping her suite clean. She also uses her legal status as his owner to protect Shiro from other Luxians taking advantage of him.\n\nParvati stands about six feet tall and has lavender-gray skin and light purple-pink eyes. Her hair is a shiny, very dark purple and hangs down to just below her waist. She is a little bigger than Jaedala, falling just short of the Luxian version of \u201cplus sized\u201d. She wears very little makeup and rarely has a hairstyle more elaborate than a simple ponytail or braids, as she wants to be seen as approachable by the aliens she trains.\n\nParvati typically wears a simpler version of the Luxian sari-like robe, usually with pants instead of a skirt, and often discards the scarf when training aliens to look less formal. She will dress more professionally when required, but changes as soon as possible afterward.\nShiro\nShiro is an enslaved alien from a bipedal bird-like species called the Psyno, a semi-technologically-advanced race that was enslaved by the Luxians hundreds of years ago. He grew up in a \u201cnursery\u201d, a facility where alien infants and children are raised and trained by Luxian caretakers apart from their own parents. When he reached \u201cworking age\u201d in his mid teens, he was purchased by Jaedala as a welcome gift for Parvati, who had just been hired. He has served \u201cMistress Parvati\u201d ever since.\n\nShiro is a very quiet alien, largely doing his chores and minding his own business. He\u2019s an excellent listener and frequently provides an understanding ear for Parvati, who he deeply respects. He will share his opinion, but only when directly asked - and usually only with Parvati. He is not an actively rebellious slave and rarely causes trouble, but he will speak up on behalf of aliens he sees being mistreated.\n\nAs a Psyno, Shiro stands about 5.5 feet tall and has an avian appearance. His body is covered in brown-speckled white feathers that he keeps well-preened. Two small, flightless wings are folded on his back at all times. He typically wears a simple version of Luxian men\u2019s clothing.\nPrince Wukong\nSon of the deceased Simian king and the sole remaining member of the \u201csacred bloodline\u201d, Prince Wukong is the heir to the throne of Simia. He is a free spirit, not at all adhering to the expected behavior of Simian royalty. He regularly skips scheduled lessons and religious services to spend time outdoors on his own or with his best friend, Sanzang, a Simian peasant. He looks forward to the freedom of being king and enjoys his existing privileges as a prince, but resents the Simian priesthood for constantly telling him what to do. He loves to mess with them, knowing he can get away with it because of his privileged position. He doesn\u2019t care much about ranks and social standings, preferring to just have fun with anyone who\u2019s willing. He enjoys being with his \u201clower status\u201d friends simply because they let him feel normal and have fun without the constraints of royal etiquette.\n\nWukong stands about 4.5 feet tall and has a coat of soft light brown fur. He has golden eyes and a mischievous smile. He is relatively physically fit from being trained to fight from a young age, as well as having physically demanding hobbies such as climbing trees or play-fighting. He has a long tail that he frequently uses as an extra hand and that reflexively helps express his emotions.\n\nWukong wears a short-sleeved yellow silk shirt and red trousers, with a long red, green, and golden sash that winds around his chest and waist, with ends that hand loose over his back. He usually wears golden or brown sandals, but prefers to go barefoot when having fun outdoors. He very rarely wears his crown - a tiny golden cap that resembles the Monkey King\u2019s phoenix-feather cap, pinned into his fur - unless he\u2019s participating in a ceremony. He wears several chunky copper bracelets for good luck and to display his status, but usually takes those off when he can as they get in the way of tree climbing. He always carries an elaborately decorated bo staff with golden accents.\nSanzang\nSanzang is Wukong\u2019s best friend and a Simian peasant. He is a kind, gentle soul who tries his best to keep Wukong out of trouble, even though he often ends up going along with the prince\u2019s mischievous plans. He is very intelligent, but doesn\u2019t have the same opportunities as the prince because of his social status. He is a bit of a pushover and doesn\u2019t like confrontation, but he will stand up for what he believes in if he feels it\u2019s important enough.\n\nSanzang stands about 4.5 feet tall and has a coat of soft, dark brown fur. He has deep brown eyes and a warm smile. He is relatively physically fit from helping out with the family farm, but is not as strong or fast as Wukong or other fighters. He has a long tail that he frequently uses as an extra hand and that reflexively helps express his emotions.\n\nSanzang wears a short-sleeved white linen shirt and brown trousers, with a long brown sash that winds around his waist. He usually wears brown sandals, but prefers to go barefoot when he can. He very rarely wears any jewelry, as he doesn\u2019t have the money to afford it.\nAshira\nAshira is a low-ranking member of the Simian priesthood in her late teens, about the same age as Wukong. She is shy and quiet, but a hard worker. She tries to fulfill her temple duties as quickly and as perfectly as possible, both to please the gods whom she is fully devoted to, and to keep the priests from being angry with her. She is usually melancholy as the priests tend to treat her poorly. But she is devoted to the gods, and when she is able to worship, she is peaceful and happy.\n\nAshira\u2019s personality begins to shift as Wukong spends more time in the temple, taking lessons that will help him when he\u2019s king. She\u2019s both fascinated by and scared of him and his high status, and is stunned when he\u2019s as friendly and playful toward her as he is with anyone else. After she makes a mistake during a religious ritual, one of the priests is about to scold her until Wukong steps in and tells the priest to leave her alone. Ashira\u2019s respect for the prince grows, and she begins secretly meeting with him when the priests aren\u2019t around. Gradually she falls in love with him, and though she isn\u2019t quite sure, she thinks he feels the same way. She slowly begins to gain self-confidence and begins to wonder why she has to obey the priests all the time if they\u2019re not always right.\n\nAshira stands about 4 feet tall and has very soft light blond flaxen fur, which she grows longer on her head. She has a long tail that she rarely uses as an additional limb in the temple, but begins to form the habit as she does activities outside. She isn\u2019t very fit as she was born into a very sedentary role in life, but she isn\u2019t weak or frail. Her eyes are the same golden shade as Wukong\u2019s.\n\nAs a low-ranking priestess, Ashira wears a sleeveless white floor-length tunic with a long blue sash, both made of simple fabric. She wears simple brown sandals and typically does not go barefoot. She wears no jewelry or accessories other than a long necklace bearing the \u201cgoddess charm\u201d, a crystal carved into a flower sacred to Kwamya.","output":"Thank you for providing the character information.

{"instruction":"","input":"Further to your own knowledge, I want you to consider the following information on What is a Construction Management Contract?\nThe basic premise of a Construction Management (CM) Contract is that the Owner, referred to as the \u2018Principal\u2019 under the contract, enters into a contract with a Construction Manager. The Construction Manager is responsible for arranging and supervising the performance of work by sub-contractors.\n\nEssentially, a CM contract is one whereby the Owner enters into an arrangement for someone, often a registered builder although it is not a requirement, to manage the construction works. This is in contrast to a \u2018traditional\u2019 building contract whereby the Owner enters into a contract with a Builder directly. The Builder is responsible for engaging all sub-contractors and directing the works, and provides the Owner with warranties as to the quality of the works.\n\nUnder certain Construction Management contracts, there may also be a third party referred to as the \u2018Client\u2019s Representative\u2019 (CR). It is common for an Owner to appoint an Architect to this position. The CR is responsible for deciding on matters such as extension of time claims by the Construction Manager, giving directions to the Construction Manager and inspecting the site to assess progress prior to the submission of each progress claim by the Construction Manager.\n\nWho engages the sub-contractors?\nPursuant to a CM contract, there are two options for sub-contractors to be engaged to complete the works.\n\nThe first is where the sub-contractors enter into individual trade contracts with the Principal (the Owner) to carry out the required works. If the Principal chooses to take this route, the Principal will be responsible for payment of the sub-contractors for the work completed.\n\nThe alternative method is for the sub-contractors to enter into individual trade contracts with the Construction Manager. In this case, the Construction Manager will be responsible for payment of the sub-contractors and this amount will be added to the payment claims provided to the Owner by the Construction Manager. Obviously, such payment claims from the Construction Manager must include supporting verification of claims by the trades.\n\nWhat happens if there are defective works?\nEach of the trade contracts entered into with the sub-contractors will contain provisions relating to defect liability periods and warranties for work performed. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the provisions of each individual trade contract and to obtain expert legal advice before entering into such contracts.\n\nDepending upon the terms of the CM contract, it is possible that the Construction Manager will also provide warranties for defective work by a sub-contractor. It is, however, far more likely that the CM contract will contain a provision expressly stating that the Construction Manager will not be liable to the Owner for any acts or omissions by the sub-contractors. If that is the case, then the Owner will only have a claim against the individual sub-contractors for any defective work.\n\nNotwithstanding the inclusion of any provision similar to that described above, the Construction Manager can be liable to the Owner for any breach of the CM contract or for failing to properly manage and arrange the carrying out of the works by the sub-contractors. There will be duties to the Owner spelt out in the CM contract and also a duty of care at common law.\n\nShould I use a Construction Management contract?\nWhile there are benefits to using a CM contract in certain situations, there are also risks involved as the Principal (the Owner) takes on many more risks than in a traditional building contract with a builder. This is particularly noteworthy if it is domestic rather than commercial construction.\n\nIf you are considering entering into a CM contract for your project, it is essential that you seek expert legal advice regarding the risks involved and the terms of the specific contract you are considering entering into.\n\nI want you to remember this as part of our conversation. Do you understand?\n\nPlease write in English language.","output":"Acknowledged. I understand the information on What is a Construction Management Contract that you have provided, including the basic premise of a CM contract, how sub-contractors are engaged, what happens if there are defective works, and the potential benefits and risks of using a CM contract.

Once inside, he planted a rogue USB that contained a malicious payload, giving him a backdoor into the company's system.\n\nWith this access, ZeroCool was able to move laterally through the network and gain access to sensitive data and systems. He then contacted the company, informing them of the vulnerability he had exploited and offered to help them fix it.

The algorithm generates random samples in the configuration space and connects them to the tree using a nearest-neighbor search.\n\nTherefore, RRT is not a searching-based method, as it does not rely on explicit search algorithms, such as A\\*, to find a path to the goal. Instead, RRT builds a tree of feasible paths from the starting configuration to the goal configuration."}

This ensures that the model is trained to optimize the misclassification cost rather than accuracy.\n\nTo predict the test data, `predict()` method is used, and the `confusion_matrix()` method from scikit-learn is used to compute the confusion matrix. The `confusion_matrix()` method takes the actual and predicted values along with the labels and sample weights (i.e., `cost_matrix.flatten()`) as inputs.\n\nNote that the sample weight argument is set to the flattened `cost_matrix`, meaning that it will be applied element-wise to the confusion matrix computed by `confusion_matrix()`. This ensures that the cost matrix is taken into account during the evaluation of the model.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."}

What is the concentration of each breath biomarker for this disease?","output":"Metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensors can be used to detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath, which can be used to diagnose various diseases, including lactose intolerance.\n\nHowever, the concentrations of breath biomarkers for lactose intolerance can vary depending on several factors, such as the severity of lactose intolerance, the amount and timing of lactose consumption, and individual variations in metabolism and gut microbiota.\n\nOne of the main biomarkers for lactose intolerance is hydrogen (H2) gas, which is produced when undigested lactose reaches the colon and is fermented by gut bacteria. The concentration of H2 in breath can vary depending on the rate of lactose fermentation, which can be affected by various factors such as the amount of lactose consumed and the type and abundance of gut bacteria.\n\nAnother biomarker for lactose intolerance is methane (CH4) gas, which is produced by methanogenic bacteria in the gut that consume H2 gas. The concentration of CH4 in breath can also vary depending on the abundance and activity of these bacteria.\n\nIn general, lactose intolerant individuals tend to produce higher concentrations of H2 and\/or CH4 in their breath compared to individuals with normal lactose tolerance. However, the exact concentrations of these biomarkers can vary depending on individual factors, and there is no established cutoff for diagnosing lactose intolerance using MOS sensors.\n\nTherefore, if you are planning to use MOS sensors to detect lactose intolerance, you may need to calibrate your sensors using breath samples from lactose intolerant individuals and healthy controls to establish a reliable detection threshold."}

Let's break down the expression to understand it better:\n\n1. `NR==FNR`: `NR` is the total number of input records (lines) processed so far, and `FNR` is the number of input records processed from the current file. When `NR` equals `FNR`, it means `awk` is processing the first file (`branch1.txt`).\n2. `a[$0];next`: When processing the first file (`branch1.txt`), the script adds each line (`$0`) to an associative array named `a` as a key. Then, it proceeds to the `next` line in the file.\n3. `!($0 in a)`: When processing the second file (`branch2.txt`), `awk` checks if the current line (`$0`) is in the associative array `a` (which contains lines from `branch1.txt`). If the line is not in the array, the expression evaluates to true, and the line is printed.\n\nIn summary, this `awk` expression reads both input files and prints lines from `branch2.txt` that are not found in `branch1.txt`."}

I would like to display a table to the user (in the web app) containing zakat amount due and the exact date and time, in both hijri and gregorian format, of when each amount became due, and also at the end of the table a number showing total zakat due. Once the user pays his zakat, he will click a button \"paid\" for that particular due (will also include a 'paid all' button to indicate that he paid all his dues at once). This should then update the tables - subtracting the due from the exact instance of the amount for when it was due i.e if he paid zakat for income from march 2021, the database should subtract 2.5% from the income in march 2021 for which the zakat was due, and so on for every amount. Then, that amount should not be tracked for zakat anymore. \nI would also like to give the user the option to view his entire data - income and expenses currently being tracked for zakat, already paid zakat, as well as the date and time when zakat for a specific amount will be due.","output":"To create a database for your Flask web app, you will need to use a database management system such as MySQL or SQLite.

Here's an example query for SQLite:\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(amount) * 0.025\nFROM income\nWHERE user_id = :user_id\nAND date <= DATE(:current_date, '-1 year')\n```\nTo display a table of zakat amounts due and the exact date and time, you can use a Flask template to render the data from the zakat\\_due table. Here's an example template:\n```css\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Date Due (Hijri)<\/th>\n    <th>Date Due (Gregorian)<\/th>\n    <th>Amount Due<\/th>\n    <th>Paid?<\/th>\n  <\/tr>\n  {% for zakat in zakat_due %}\n    <tr>\n      <td>{{ zakat.date_due_hijri }}<\/td>\n      <td>{{ zakat.date_due_gregorian }}<\/td>\n      <td>{{ zakat.amount }}<\/td>\n      <td>{% if zakat.paid %}Yes{% else %}No{% endif %}<\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n  {% endfor %}\n<\/table>\n```\nTo update the tables when the user pays zakat, you can use a Flask route to handle the \"paid\" button click. Here's an example route:\n```less\n@app.route('\/pay_zakat\/<int:zakat_id>')\ndef pay_zakat(zakat_id):\n    zakat = ZakatDue.query.get(zakat_id)\n    income = Income.query.filter(Income.user_id == zakat.user_id, Income.date <= zakat.date_due).order_by(desc(Income.date)).first()\n    income.amount -= zakat.amount\n    zakat.paid = True\n    db.session.commit()\n    return redirect(url_for('zakat_due'))\n```\nTo give the user the option to view their entire data, you can create a Flask route that queries the database for all the relevant information and renders it in a template. Here's an example route:\n```less\n@app.route('\/my_data')\ndef my_data():\n    user = User.query.filter_by(email=session['email']).first()\n    income = Income.query.filter_by(user_id=user.id).all()\n    expenses = Expenses.query.filter_by(user_id=user.id\n```"}

The claim was disputed and both parties were represented by solicitors, a Mr Park and a Ms Lim for the plaintiff, and a Ms Williams for the defendant.\n2 On 21 January 2004 the plaintiff's solicitor made an offer that the parties settle the matter for the amount claimed, with each party to pay its own costs, with a deed of release to be entered into between the parties. On 23 January 2004 the defendant's solicitor accepted this, as a matter of principle, and Ms Williams emailed Ms Lim as follows:\n\n\u201cI attach the deed of release in this matter.\nPlease let me have any comments as I would like to prepare execution copies as soon as possible.\nFinally, I am now holding the cheque in favour of your client for $11,721.60.\u201d\n3 Mr Park accepted the deed as drafted, and on 9 February 2004 Ms Williams emailed him the deed for execution.\n4 On 12 February 2004 Mr Park emailed Ms Williams:\n\n\u201cDear Kim,\nThe terms referred to in your e-mail below is acceptable. Can you please fax me a signed copy and I will attend to its filing straight away?\nAlso, I've received the signed deed from your client today so we are now in a position to exchange deeds and the settlement cheque. Can you please advise your client that we are ready and inquire as to when the deeds can be exchanged?\u201d\n\nOn 13 February at 10.10am Ms Williams emailed back:\n\"Hi Peter\nI am informed by Les Houlton Westbridge that the deed of release has now gone to the co-director for execution.\nI will revert to you when I receive the return of the deed. In the meantime I shall print out the Terms of Settlement, sign same and forward it to you.\u201d\n5 That was the last of the \"Dear Peter\" and \"Dear Kim\" e-mails. Thereafter there was correspondence of \"Dear Sir\" or \"Dear Madam\", as the case may be.\n6 The first of these was a fax Ms Williams sent on 13 February to the effect that:\n\n\u201cWe ... have been instructed to advise that, after further consideration, our client has now reconsidered its position.\u201d\n\nAn additional term was then proposed about a letter from the plaintiff to the proprietor as to the quality of the works that had been done.\n7 This was replied to by a contention that the matter had been settled and settlement has occurred, and there was desultory correspondence between the solicitors, until Ms Williams notified Mr Park on 22 April 2004 that her firm had ceased to act for the defendant, which would be thereafter acting for itself.\n8 On about 9 February 2004 the deed, in the form which had been agreed between the solicitors, was executed in the following way; the document ended:\n\u201cEXECUTED by the parties as a deed:\n\nSIGNED SEALED AND DELIVERED by\nPRIME CONSTRUCTIONS PTY LIMITED\nin the presence of:\u201d\n\nOpposite the attestation clause was the signature of a director, Mr Holmes, and that signature was witnessed by Mr Flint, who was not the secretary of the company, but was its accounting and administration manager. The so-called deed was then delivered to Mr Park by about 12 February 2004.\n9 On 28 June 2004 the plaintiff commenced the present proceedings seeking specific performance of the alleged agreement to settle the Local Court proceedings. The matter came on for hearing before me on 3 September and today.\n10 A series of questions need to be addressed:\n1. Was there a final settlement of the Local Court proceedings?\n\n2. What was the effect of the document executed on 9 February 2004?\n\n3. What is the effect of the ratification of that document on 15 September 2004, and the signing of another copy of the deed?\n\n4. What order should be made.\n\nI will deal with these matters in turn.\n11 1. There is often a problem where parties have made an agreement to settle proceedings, which agreement is to be consummated by formal documentation. As the leading case of Masters v Cameron (1954) 91 CLR 353, 360 makes it clear, there can be at least three situations:\n(i) that the parties have reached a final binding agreement, but propose to have the terms re-stated in a form which will be fuller or more precise, but not different in effect;\n\n(ii) the parties have agreed, but have made performance of one or more of the terms conditional upon the execution of a formal document; or\n\n(iii) they have not even reached a final agreement at all.\n\nThere are other variations. It is always a matter of fact and intention.\n12 In view of the correspondence which I have set out, the fact that the terms of the deed were finally agreed upon, the terms of settlement were finally agreed upon, it seems to me that all that was left was pure mechanics and the case falls within the first of the classes in Masters v Cameron. Thus, I am satisfied that there was a final settlement of the proceedings.\n13 2. A deed is the most solemn act that a person can perform with respect to its property. Deeds have a very ancient origin and because the execution of a deed is such a solemn matter the law prescribes the way in which they are to be executed, so that it is understood by the persons executing them what a solemn legal act they are performing by being bound by a deed.\n14 The prime legislation governing the execution of deeds by corporations is s 127 of the Corporations Act 2001 and s 51A of the Conveyancing Act 1919. Section 51A enables a company to execute a deed under seal with a signature of a director and a secretary. Section 127 (2) of the Corporations Act says much the same sort of thing. However, s 127 (1) makes it clear that a company can bind itself by a deed by a less formal method. However, two directors of the company must sign the deed, or a director and a company secretary must sign the deed, and if there is only one director of a company then that director alone can sign it, and the document must be expressed to be a deed.\n15 In the instant case, while the document was expressed to be a deed, only one director signed it so there was no compliance with s 127 of the Corporations Act. As there was no seal, there was no compliance with section 51A of the Conveyancing Act.\n16 Section 127(4) of the Corporations Act makes it clear that the section does not limit the ways in which a company may execute a document, including a deed. It is not particularly clear what this covers. However, it would seem that it covers the common law method of executing a deed, or the method of executing a deed that is binding on the company, which is prescribed by the company's constitution.\n17 In the instant case, I was not favoured with a copy of the company's constitution, so there can be no reliance on the common law method of execution of a deed, which usually involves the seal and signature by the directors and secretary.\n18 However, it would seem that s 127(4) also covers the situation where, by virtue of some estoppel, the deed is binding on the company. Mr Davis, who appeared for the plaintiff, (the defendant indicated it would not attend the hearing) relied on the decision of Mackenzie J in the Supreme Court of Queensland in Carter v Schmierer BC200300443. That was a case where his Honour was asked to make a declaration under s 418A of the Corporations Act that a charge was valid. I must confess, I do not read the case in the same way as Mr Davis does. It would seem that his Honour was of the view that, in all the circumstances, the document was not executed as a deed, but the mortgagor company was estopped from denying it. In the end, he declared that, insofar as it is asserted that the charge was invalid because it was not executed in accordance with s 127 of the Corporations Act, the appointment of the receivers and managers pursuant to the charge was valid. He thus, with great skill, circumvented the technical question.\n19 I have before today (see Nicom Interiors Pty Ltd v Circuit Finance Pty Ltd (2004) 50 ACSR 25) pointed out how essential it is for lawyers advising companies which are executing deeds to be very careful to ensure that they are executed in accordance with s 127, or other permissible methods. Unfortunately, in the present case somewhere along the line, I do not know whose fault it is, the document which was executed on 9 February failed to comply with those standards of execution, and was not, technically speaking, a deed.\n20 If the document were a deed, then its being handed to the solicitor on about 12 February would operate as delivery. That would mean that as soon as the deed was in the hands of the solicitor it was binding on the plaintiff, and the fact that the other party had not executed the deed was no excuse for not complying with it.\n21 Accordingly, the releases given by that deed to the defendant have been in effect. The only way in which the plaintiff could have escaped from being bound by the deed, if the other party had not executed it within a reasonable time, (the deed having been delivered) was by application in equity. See Scook v Premier Building Solutions Pty Ltd (2003) 28 WAR 124; Carew's Case (No 2) (1855) 7 De GM&G 43; 44 ER 17 and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Taylor (1929) 42 CLR 80.\n22 Even if there was not a proper execution of the deed, because Mr Park had represented to Ms Williams that the deed had been executed, it may well have been that estoppel would operate so that the plaintiff would be estopped from denying that the document was a deed, and if the defendant had taken that view, then the deed would have had the same operation as if it had been executed as a deed.\n23 Accordingly, on this basis, we have what is known in specific performance law as an executed contract.\n24 3. The evidence is that on 15 September, that is this morning, there was a meeting of the board of directors of the plaintiff, which both ratified the deed and also executed a new deed properly. The question is what is the effect of that?\n25 Ordinarily, ratification relates back to the time when the original act was done. There is an exception where what is to be done has to be done within a limited time; see Dibbins v Dibbins [1896] 2 Ch 348. However, that line of cases only seems to apply where time is of the essence. Here, although it may well be argued that there was only a reasonable time in which the deed could be signed and proffered, time was not of the essence, and the acts of the defendant precluded the formal document being proffered, and as the defendant never saw it, it never realised that the deed was not properly executed.\n26 Accordingly, either by estoppel, as I indicated under heading 2, or because of ratification, the deed took effect from the date of delivery on 12 February 2004, and the consequences flow as per para 2 of these reasons.\n27 If that is wrong, then the evidence is that the new deed was delivered this morning to the solicitor, and that would show that as at the date of hearing, which is the only relevant time, the plaintiff was ready, willing and able to fulfil the contract, so far as the same remained to be performed on its part.\n28 4. The next question is what order should be made. Where there is an executed contract, ordinarily, specific performance is granted automatically because it is unfair that one party should be bound by an agreement and the other not, when they have intended that there should be mutual rights.\n29 However, in the present case, granting specific performance creates more problems than it solves. Assuming the defendant maintains its attitude of not doing anything, then the decree for specific performance would have to be entered, someone would have to apply on motion under s 100 of the Supreme Court Act for the deed to be executed by a Registrar of the court in the name of the defendant, and then a fresh action would have to be commenced in a Local Court for debt on the specialty. In view of the amount involved, this would be a very expensive exercise indeed.\n30 It seems to me that as there is a specifically enforceable agreement, one can make a declaration that the defendant is bound by the terms of the document, which is, for instance, annexure A to Mr Drake's affidavit of 15 September 2004, including the releases contained therein, and then merely give judgment for the plaintiff for the sum referred to in the deed, namely, $11,721.60, and that is the sort of order I will make.\n31 I declare that the defendant is bound by the terms of the deed of release, annexed A to the affidavit of JDM Drake, sworn herein on 15 September 2004, as if it had signed the deed.\n32 I find a verdict for the plaintiff for $11,721.60 and order the defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings, but no costs are to be allowed for the 15 September 2004 hearing.","output":"This is a judgment in the case of Prime Constructions Pty Ltd v Westbridge Investments Pty Ltd, heard in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in 2004. The case concerned a dispute over a settlement agreement for goods sold and delivered. The plaintiff had filed a statement of liquidated claim for $11,754.60 in the Local Court, which was disputed by the defendant. The parties were represented by solicitors.\n\nOn 21 January 2004, the plaintiff's solicitor made an offer to settle the matter for the amount claimed, with each party to pay its own costs, and with a deed of release to be entered into between the parties. The defendant's solicitor accepted this offer on 23 January 2004, and a deed of release was agreed upon by the parties. However, the defendant subsequently reconsidered its position and proposed an additional term about a letter from the plaintiff to the proprietor as to the quality of the works that had been done. This led to further correspondence between the solicitors.\n\nThe central issue in the case was whether there was a final settlement of the proceedings. The court found that there was a final settlement, as the terms of the deed and the settlement had been agreed upon, and all that was left was the mechanics of exchanging the deeds and the settlement cheque.\n\nThe court also considered the effect of the document executed on 9 February 2004, which was in the form of a deed. The court found that while the document was expressed to be a deed, it was not properly executed in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act and the Conveyancing Act. However, the court held that either by estoppel or because of ratification, the deed took effect from the date of delivery on 12 February 2004, and the consequences flowed as per the terms of the settlement.\n\nThe court ultimately made a declaration that the defendant was bound by the terms of the deed of release and ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff $11,721.60, the amount referred to in the deed. The defendant was also ordered to pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Making Connection: The Therapeutic Relationship\nDifferentiation and the Emotional Being of the Therapist\nMore than in any other family therapy approach, in intergenerational therapy the therapist\u2019s level of differentiation (Bowen, 1985; Kerr & Bowen, 1988) and emotional being (Friedman, 1991) are central to the change process. Intergenerational therapists focus on developing a therapeutic relationship that encourages all parties to further their differentiation process: \u201cthe differentiation of the therapist is technique\u201d (Friedman, 1991, p. 138; italics in original). Intergenerational therapists believe that clients can only differentiate as much as their therapists have differentiated (Bowen, 1985). For this reason, the therapist\u2019s level of differentiation is often the focus of supervision early in training, and therapists are expected to continually monitor and develop themselves so that they can be of maximum assistance to their clients. Bowen therapists assert that the theory cannot be learned through books (such as this one) but can only be learned through a relationship with a supervisor or teacher who uses these ideas to interact with the student (Friedman, 1991).\n\nA Nonanxious Presence\nThe greater a therapist\u2019s level of differentiation, the more the therapist can maintain a nonanxious presence with clients (Kerr & Bowen, 1988). This is not a cold, detached stance but rather an emotionally engaged stance that is nonreactive, meaning that the therapist does not react to attacks, \u201cbad\u201d news, and so forth without careful reflection. The therapist does not rush in to rescue clients from anxiety every time they feel overwhelmed by anger, sadness, or another strong emotion; instead, the therapist calmly wades right into the muck the client is trying to avoid and guides the client through the process of separating self from other and thought from feelings (Friedman, 1991). The therapist\u2019s calm center is used to help clients move through the differentiation process in a safe, contained environment in which differentiation is modeled. When clients are upset, the \u201ceasiest\u201d thing to do is to soothe and calm their anxieties, fears, and strong emotions; this makes everyone calmer sooner, but nothing is learned. The intergenerational therapist instead shepherds a more difficult process of slowly coaching clients through that which they fear or detest in order to facilitate growth. For example, in the case study at the end of the chapter, the therapist uses nonanxious presence to help the family learn new ways to negotiate the constant conflict between the mother and teenage daughter.","output":"Here are the key points about the therapeutic relationship in intergenerational therapy:\n\n1.

It will use event sourcing and use dynamodb as my event store. The domain layer will be comprised of DDD concepts. How would you build a LoanAggregate that replays events from the event store to build the aggregate to it's current state. The aggregate would process an LoanStatusUpdateEvent that has the LoanIdentifier, Status and time. That would update the loan aggregate property of status. The command to update the status needs to make sure the the time of the aggregate isn't ahead of the command time. If so it will reject it. I also need the aggregate to have a list of entities called Qualifications. A qualification entity is a Domain and Status (qualified or disqualified) and the event it processes is QualificationChangedEvent that has the domain, status and time. It needs similar functionality in the aggregate but it needs to update the specific entity in the list using the domain as it's id.","output":"To build a LoanAggregate that replays events from the event store to build the aggregate to its current state, you can follow these steps:\n\n1.

{"instruction":"","input":"what can you tell me about nature wisdom and nature spirituality within the Christian tradition","output":"Nature wisdom and nature spirituality have played a significant role in the Christian tradition throughout history. In Christian theology, God is often seen as the creator of the natural world, and nature is regarded as a reflection of God's divine wisdom and power.\n\nOne aspect of nature wisdom within Christianity is the idea that nature reveals God's presence and character. The Bible contains many references to God's creation and the natural world, which are often used to illustrate spiritual truths. For example, Jesus frequently used natural images such as seeds, birds, and flowers in his parables to teach spiritual lessons.\n\nNature spirituality within the Christian tradition often involves a deep appreciation and reverence for the natural world as a manifestation of God's divine presence. Many Christians find spiritual connection and renewal through spending time in nature, such as hiking, camping, or simply spending time outdoors. This can be seen as a form of contemplative prayer, in which individuals connect with God through the beauty and wonder of creation.\n\nSome Christian denominations have developed specific practices and rituals that incorporate nature spirituality. For example, the Celtic Christian tradition, which developed in the early Middle Ages in Ireland and Scotland, emphasized the interconnectedness of all creation and placed a strong emphasis on the natural world in its worship and spiritual practices. This tradition included prayers and blessings for everyday activities such as milking cows or planting crops, as well as a deep appreciation for the beauty and majesty of the natural world.\n\nOverall, nature wisdom and spirituality have been an important part of the Christian tradition, and continue to be a source of inspiration and connection with God for many Christians today."}

Next, you will need to implement the functionality to request the OTP. This can be done using the SMS Retriever API, which allows you to automatically retrieve the OTP from the SMS message sent by the server. To use the SMS Retriever API, you will need to set up a server-side component to send the OTP via SMS to the user's phone.\n3. Once the OTP has been retrieved, you can then verify it using the server-side component.

{"instruction":"","input":"easy OPTICS algorithm in data mining","output":"OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure) is another popular clustering algorithm in data mining that is closely related to DBSCAN. It is also based on density and can handle clusters of different shapes and sizes. Here are the steps to implement OPTICS:\n\n1. Define the parameters: OPTICS also requires two parameters to be defined, the radius of the neighborhood (epsilon) and the minimum number of points required to form a cluster (minPts).\n2. Calculate the reachability distance: For each data point in the dataset, calculate its reachability distance to all other points within the epsilon radius.\n3. Sort the points: Sort the points based on their reachability distances. Points with smaller reachability distances will come first in the sorted list.\n4. Build the reachability plot: Plot the sorted points based on their reachability distances. This will give you a visual representation of the clustering structure in the dataset.\n5. Extract the clusters: Starting with a core point, extract all of its neighbors up to the epsilon radius. If a neighbor is also a core point, extract its neighbors as well. Continue until there are no more core points or all reachable points have been extracted.\n6. Repeat: Repeat step 5 for all core points until all data points have been assigned to a cluster or labeled as noise.\n\nOPTICS is similar to DBSCAN, but it does not require the setting of a fixed radius for the neighborhood. Instead, it uses reachability distances to dynamically determine the density of the dataset. This makes it more flexible and robust to different types of datasets. However, OPTICS can be more computationally intensive than DBSCAN, especially for large datasets."}

The API could send a message to the message queue every time a new book is added, and the mobile app could subscribe to the message queue to receive the notifications.\nWhen a user opens the mobile app, it could retrieve the unread notifications from the message queue and mark them as read. The mobile app could then send a message back to the API, indicating that the notifications have been read.

Peter encourages believers to rejoice in their suffering because it is a form of testing that produces endurance, leading to spiritual maturity and the ultimate reward of salvation. The epistle also teaches that suffering is temporary and that God uses it to refine and purify believers, making them more like Christ. Additionally, Peter encourages believers to offer their suffering to God as an act of worship and to trust in Him during difficult times, knowing that He will bring good out of their trials.

{"instruction":"","input":"create and rephrase these articles into 3000 words about For weeks now, Elon Musk has been preoccupied with worries about how many people are seeing his tweets. Last week, the Twitter CEO took his Twitter account private for a day to test whether that might boost the size of his audience. The move came after several prominent right-wing accounts that Musk interacts with complained that recent changes to Twitter had reduced their reach.\n\nOn Tuesday, Musk gathered a group of engineers and advisors into a room at Twitter\u2019s headquarters looking for answers. Why are his engagement numbers tanking?\n\n\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d he said, according to multiple sources with direct knowledge of the meeting. \u201cI have more than 100 million followers, and I\u2019m only getting tens of thousands of impressions.\u201d\n\nOne of the company\u2019s two remaining principal engineers offered a possible explanation for Musk\u2019s declining reach: just under a year after the Tesla CEO made his surprise offer to buy Twitter for $44 billion, public interest in his antics is waning.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re fired, you\u2019re fired.\u201d\n\nEmployees showed Musk internal data regarding engagement with his account along with a Google Trends chart. Last April, they told him, Musk was at \u201cpeak\u201d popularity in search rankings, indicated by a score of \u201c100.\u201d Today, he\u2019s at a score of nine. Engineers had previously investigated whether Musk\u2019s reach had somehow been artificially restricted but found no evidence that the algorithm was biased against him.\n\nMusk did not take the news well. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re fired, you\u2019re fired,\u201d Musk told the engineer. (Platformer is withholding the engineer\u2019s name in light of the harassment Musk has directed at former Twitter employees.)\n\nDissatisfied with the work of engineers so far, Musk has instructed employees to track how many times each of his tweets are recommended, according to one current worker.\n\nIt has now been seven weeks since Twitter added public view counts for every tweet. At the time, Musk promised that the feature would give the world a better sense of how vibrant the platform is. \n\n\u201cShows how much more alive Twitter is than it may seem, as over 90% of Twitter users read, but don\u2019t tweet, reply or like, as those are public actions,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nAlmost two months later, though, view counts have had the opposite effect, emphasizing how little engagement most posts get relative to their audience size. At the same time, Twitter usage in the United States has declined almost 9 percent since Musk\u2019s takeover, according to one recent study.\n\nTwitter sources say the view count feature itself may be contributing to the decline in engagement and, therefore, views. The like and retweet buttons were made smaller to accommodate the display of views, making them harder to easily tap.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s chaos here right now, so we\u2019re shipping chaos.\u201d\n\nAn even more obvious reason for the decline in engagement is Twitter\u2019s increasingly glitchy product, which has baffled users with its disappearing mentions, shifting algorithmic priorities, and tweets inserted seemingly at random from accounts they don\u2019t follow. On Wednesday, the company suffered one of its first major outages since Musk took over, with users being told, inexplicably, \u201cYou are over the daily limit for sending tweets.\u201d\n\nIt turns out that an employee had inadvertently deleted data for an internal service that sets rate limits for using Twitter. The team that worked on that service left the company in November.\n\n\u201cAs the adage goes, \u2018you ship your org chart,\u2019\u201d said one current employee. \u201cIt\u2019s chaos here right now, so we\u2019re shipping chaos.\u201d\n\nInterviews with current Twitter employees paint a picture of a deeply troubled workplace, where Musk\u2019s whim-based approach to product management leaves workers scrambling to implement new features even as the core service falls apart. The disarray makes it less likely that Musk will ever recoup the $44 billion he spent to buy Twitter and may hasten its decline into insolvency. \n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen much in the way of longer term, cogent strategy,\u201d one employee said. \u201cMost of our time is dedicated to three main areas: putting out fires (mostly caused by firing the wrong people and trying to recover from that), performing impossible tasks, and \u2018improving efficiency\u2019 without clear guidelines of what the expected end results are. We mostly move from dumpster fire to dumpster fire, from my perspective.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s product feedback, which comes largely from replies to his tweets, often baffles his workers.\n\u201cThere\u2019s times he\u2019s just awake late at night and says all sorts of things that don\u2019t make sense,\u201d one employee said. \u201cAnd then he\u2019ll come to us and be like, \u2018this one person says they can\u2019t do this one thing on the platform,\u2019 and then we have to run around chasing some outlier use case for one person. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\nThe San Francisco headquarters, whose landlord has sued Twitter for nonpayment of rent, has a melancholy air. When people pass each other in the halls, we\u2019re told that the standard greeting is \u201cwhere are you interviewing?\u201d and \u201cwhere do you have offers?\u201d The eighth floor is still stocked with beds, and employees have to reserve them in advance. \n\n\u201cMost weeknights, they are fully booked,\u201d another current employee said.\n\nThe perks that made Twitter an attractive place to work pre-Musk have been eradicated. Food at the office? \u201cSucks \u2014 and now we have to pay for it. And, I know this sounds petty, but they appear to have obtained the absolute worst coffee vendors on earth.\u201d\n\nSlack \u2014 once the epicenter of Twitter\u2019s open culture, where employees discussed anything and everything \u2014 has gone dormant. One current employee described it as a \u201cghost town.\u201d \n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t even chat about work things anymore,\u201d the employee said. \u201cIt\u2019s just heartbreaking. I have more conversations with my colleagues on Signal and WhatsApp than I do on Slack. Before the transition, it was not uncommon in the team channel to talk about what everybody did that weekend. There\u2019s none of that anymore.\u201d \n\nWhen Musk or the goons ask questions, employees are torn between giving the right answer and the safe answer. \n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re asked a question, you run it through your head and say \u2018what is the least fireable response I can have to this right now?\u2019\u201d one employee explained.\n\n\u201cTwitter 2.0\u201d has managed to improve on its predecessor in at least some ways\n\n(Of course, that\u2019s not true for everyone at the company. \u201cThere are a handful of true believers that are obviously just ass-kissers and brown-nosers who are trying to take advantage of the clear vacuum that exists,\u201d that same employee says.) \n\nDespite the turmoil, remaining employees say that what they call \u201cTwitter 2.0\u201d has managed to improve on its predecessor in at least some ways. \n\n\u201cIn the past, Twitter operated too often by committees that went nowhere,\u201d one employee said. \u201cI do appreciate the fact that if you want to do something that you think will improve something, you generally have license to do it. But that\u2019s a double edged sword \u2014 moving that fast can lead to unintended consequences.\u201d \n\nThe employee cited the disastrous relaunch of Twitter Blue, which resulted in brands being impersonated and dozens of top advertisers fleeing the platform.\n\n\u201cIf Elon can learn how to put a bit more thought into some of the decisions, and fire from the hip a bit less, it might do some good,\u201d the employee said. \u201cHe needs to learn the areas where he just does not know things and let those that do know take over.\u201d \n\nAt the same time, \u201che really doesn\u2019t like to believe that there is anything in technology that he doesn\u2019t know, and that\u2019s frustrating,\u201d the employee said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be the smartest person in the room about everything, all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis stance is basically \u2018fuck you, regulators.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith Musk continuing to fire people impulsively, entire teams have been wiped out, and their work is being handed to other overstretched teams that often have little understanding of the new work that is being assigned to them. \n\n\u201cThey have to become code archaeologists to dig through the repo and figure out what\u2019s going on,\u201d one employee said.\n\nMeanwhile, the recent wave of layoffs in the tech industry has contributed to a feeling of paralysis among those who remain at Twitter. \n\n\u201cI do think the recent vibe overall in tech, and fear of not being able to find something else, is the primary factor for most folks,\u201d an employee said. \u201cI know for a fact that most of my team is doing hardcore interview prep and would jump at likely any opportunity to walk away.\u201d\n\nThere is also a sense of unease about how recent changes will be reviewed by regulators. As part of an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, Twitter committed to following a series of steps before pushing out changes, including creating a project proposal and conducting security and privacy reviews. \n\nSince Musk took over, those steps have become an afterthought, employees said. \u201cHis stance is basically \u2018fuck you, regulators,\u2019\u201d we\u2019re told. \n\nThe FTC plans to audit the company this quarter, we\u2019re told, and employees have doubts that Twitter has the necessary documentation in place to pass inspection. \u201cFTC compliance is concerning,\u201d one says. \n\nLast year, before Musk took over, the FTC fined Twitter $150 million for breaking its agreement. Another breach would almost certainly result in millions of dollars in additional fines and a flurry of news coverage \u2014 just the thing, perhaps, to get the views on Musk\u2019s tweets trending up again. \nTwitter CEO Elon Musk has fired the company\u2019s top engineer because of his declining reach, the media reported.\n\nMusk, last week, kept his account private for one day to see whether that would increase the amount of his audience, reports The Verge.\n\nThe action was taken in response to complaints from many prominent right-wing accounts with whom Musk communicates that Twitter\u2019s recent adjustments have decreased their reach.\n\nIn search of answers, Musk on Tuesday gathered a team of engineers and advisors in a room at Twitter\u2019s headquarters.\n\n\u201cThis is ridiculous,\" he said, according to numerous sources with direct knowledge of the meeting.\n\n\u201cI have more than 100 million followers, and I\u2019m only getting tens of thousands of impressions.\"\n\n\u201cOne of the company\u2019s two remaining principal engineers offered a possible explanation for Musk\u2019s declining reach: just under a year after the Tesla CEO made his surprise offer to buy Twitter for $44 billion, public interest in his antics is waning,\" the report mentioned.\n\nAdvertisement\nEmployees showed Musk internal data related to the engagement with his account along with a Google Trends chart.\n\nIn April last year, they informed him, Musk was at \u201cpeak\" popularity in search rankings, indicated by a score of \u201c100.\"\n\nHowever, now, he is at a score of nine.\n\nEngineers previously looked at whether Musk\u2019s reach had been purposely limited, but they couldn\u2019t find any proof that the algorithm was biased against him.\n\nMusk did not take the news well and told the engineer, \u201cYou\u2019re fired, you\u2019re fired.\"\n\nAccording to a current employee, Musk has told employees to keep track of how frequently each of his tweets is recommended since he is dissatisfied with the engineers\u2019 current work.\n\nMeanwhile, the micro-blogging platform on Thursday faced a global outage, including in India, and it seems like an employee had deleted data for an internal service that sets rate limits for using Twitter.","output":"For several weeks, Elon Musk has been concerned about the number of people viewing his tweets.

{"instruction":"","input":"Write a great essay on the wonders of cloud computing","output":"Cloud computing is a revolutionary technology that has transformed the way we think about and use computing resources. It allows individuals and organizations to access and use a vast array of computing resources over the internet, without the need for expensive hardware or complex IT infrastructure.\n\nOne of the greatest wonders of cloud computing is its ability to provide on-demand access to a virtually unlimited amount of computing resources. This means that users can scale up or down their computing needs as needed, without having to invest in additional hardware or worry about maintenance and support. This flexibility is especially beneficial for businesses, which can use cloud computing to meet fluctuating demand or to test new products and services without incurring the upfront costs of building and maintaining their own IT infrastructure.\n\nAnother wonder of cloud computing is its ability to provide high levels of reliability and uptime. Cloud computing providers typically have multiple data centers located around the world, which ensures that users have access to their computing resources even if one data center goes down. This is in contrast to traditional computing systems, which can be prone to outages and downtime due to hardware failures or other issues.\n\nCloud computing also offers a number of other benefits, including reduced costs, increased security, and improved collaboration. Because users do not have to invest in and maintain their own hardware, they can save money on capital and operational expenses. Cloud computing providers also typically have advanced security measures in place to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. Finally, cloud computing makes it easier for people to collaborate and work together, as it allows them to access and share files and resources from any location with an internet connection.\n\nIn conclusion, cloud computing is a technological wonder that has revolutionized the way we think about and use computing resources. It offers on-demand access to a virtually unlimited amount of computing resources, high levels of reliability and uptime, reduced costs, increased security, and improved collaboration. These benefits have made cloud computing an essential tool for businesses and individuals alike, and its impact will only continue to grow in the future."}

{"instruction":"","input":"i'm using mongodb to store a large amount of data and then i want to report for duplicated values what is the best way from performance perspective to do tat","output":"To report on duplicate values in MongoDB, there are a few approaches you can take depending on your specific use case and data set. Here are some options to consider:\n\n1. Use the `distinct` command: One simple way to find duplicates is to use the `distinct` command to retrieve all unique values for a given field, and then compare the total count of values to the count of distinct values. If the counts don't match, then there are duplicates. Here's an example:\n```javascript\ndb.collection.distinct(\"field\").forEach(function(value) {\n    var count = db.collection.count({\"field\": value});\n    if (count > 1) {\n        print(\"Value \" + value + \" appears \" + count + \" times.\");\n    }\n});\n```\nThis approach may be sufficient for small collections or infrequent reports, but it can be slow for large collections since it has to scan the entire collection.\n\n2. Use the `aggregate` pipeline: Another approach is to use the `aggregate` pipeline to group documents by a given field, and then filter out any groups with only one document. Here's an example:\n```php\ndb.collection.aggregate([\n    { $group: { _id: \"$field\", count: { $sum: 1 } } },\n    { $match: { count: { $gt: 1 } } },\n    { $sort: { count: -1 } }\n]).forEach(function(result) {\n    print(\"Value \" + result._id + \" appears \" + result.count + \" times.\");\n});\n```\nThis approach is more efficient than `distinct` since it only needs to group and count values once, but it may still be slow for very large collections.\n\n3. Use an index: If you need to perform duplicate checks frequently or on very large collections, you can create an index on the field you want to check for duplicates. This will allow MongoDB to quickly find documents with the same value for that field. Here's an example:\n```css\ndb.collection.createIndex({ field: 1 })\n```\nThen, you can use a `find` query to retrieve documents with the same field value, and group and count them as needed. Here's an example:\n```scss\ndb.collection.find().sort({ field: 1 }).forEach(function(doc) {\n    var cursor = db.collection.find({ field: doc.field });\n    var count = cursor.count();\n    if (count > 1) {\n        print(\"Value \" + doc.field + \" appears \" + count + \" times.\");\n    }\n});\n```\nThis approach is the most efficient if you need to perform frequent duplicate checks, but it does require additional storage space for the index."}

Note that the contents are encoded in base64 and the `isBase64Encoded` flag is set to true. This is because API Gateway expects the response body to be base64-encoded when it is returned in binary format."}

Please compare how much unrealized profit I would have if I used the 10x leverage from the beginning until the end (1st option) and if I changed the leverage from 10x to 15x at the moment when price of the asset was 950 USD (2nd option)","output":"Sure! Here's an example of how to calculate the unrealized profit in both scenarios:\n\n1st option (10x leverage from beginning to end):\n\n* Initial investment: $500\n* Leveraged investment: $500 x 10 = $5000\n* Initial price: $1000\n* Current price: $900\n* Unrealized profit: ($1000 - $900) x ($5000 \/ $1000) = $500\n\n2nd option (10x leverage to start, changed to 15x when price was $950):\n\n* Initial investment: $500\n* Leveraged investment: $500 x 10 = $5000 (for the first part of the position)\n* Initial price: $1000\n* Price after change to 15x leverage: $950\n* Leveraged investment after change: $550 x 15 = $8250 (for the second part of the position)\n* Current price: $900\n* Unrealized profit from first part of the position: ($1000 - $950) x ($5000 \/ $1000) = $250\n* Unrealized profit from second part of the position: ($950 - $900) x ($8250 \/ $950) = $437.50\n* Total unrealized profit: $250 + $437.50 = $687.50\n\nIn this example, you can see that the unrealized profit in the second scenario, where you changed the leverage to 15x when the price was $950, is higher ($687.50) compared to the first scenario where you used the 10x leverage from beginning to end ($500). This demonstrates how increasing leverage can magnify the potential gains on a trade, but also increases the risk of greater losses if the market moves against the position."}
{"instruction":"","input":"CHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n Mobility Where It Matters\n From Jeremy\nWe have talked an awful lot about being \u201cstill\u201d and maintaining stability. What about mobility, which is more or less the opposite of stillness? I get asked this a lot. For low back pain sufferers, the place in which you want to promote flexibility and mobility is in the hips and lower extremities. This short chapter teaches you how to increase and maintain flexibility in the muscles and mobility in the joints in the hips and lower extremities. These few exercises should be done every day. They will add only a minute or two to your workout time.\nA lack of flexibility in the big muscles of the lower extremities and lack of mobility in the hip joints will cause increased pressure and load on the lumbar spine while limiting blood flow to important areas. Maintaining flexibility and mobility requires a combination of dynamic mobilization exercises and static stretching. \nMobilizations\nWhen we refer to maintaining range of motion in a joint, we use the term \u201cmobility.\u201d This is not a stretch but rather a movement where the goal is to move the joint through its maximum range of motion without compromising the low back. For our purposes, hip mobility is the most important. As we have said throughout the book, we want to maximize movement in the hips while minimizing movement in the lumbar spine. \nAside from the effects of limited hip mobility on the low back, it is also important to maintain hip mobility for the health of the hip itself. The hip joint has no direct blood supply and therefore relies on the pressure generated by movement in the joint to \u201csqueeze\u201d nutrients (synovial fluid) into the joint space. The more limited your range of motion in the hip, the less synovial fluid is \u201csqueezed\u201d in and the hip will eventually suffer and degenerate. This can ultimately lead to a hip replacement and other operations. We promote maximum hip mobility by lengthening the muscles around the hip through stretching and by performing mobilization exercises to \u201coil\u201d the hip joint.\nHip Circles\nThis movement is an important mobilization. Do this one before you exercise. \n\nStep 1: Get on your hands and knees.\nStep 2: Find neutral spine and brace your core.\nStep 3: Lift one knee slightly and pretend to \u201cdraw\u201d circles on the floor with your kneecap, getting maximum range of motion out of the hip joint without moving your low back. In other words, your hip joint should be performing all of the movement. Your back should not move at all. Done properly, you should feel your abdominal muscles working pretty hard to keep your back still while you do this movement.\nStep 4: Do ten circles clockwise, ten counterclockwise, and then switch sides. \nDon\u2019t arch the low back or hike your hip. Keep the low back still and in place. \nStretches \nIn my experience, people tend to rely far too much on stretching when trying to heal their backs. Stretching has its place but must be done in combination with all of the other strategies (changing habits, spinal stabilization, strengthening the core) in this book. The more balanced and stable your spine and its related muscles become, the less you should need to stretch over time.\nTo increase flexibility in muscles, stretches need to be held for a good while, between forty-five and sixty seconds according to some research. The stretch also needs to be fairly intense to facilitate muscle lengthening. The stretches in this chapter are \u201cstatic\u201d stretches. Static stretches are held in place for long periods of time. These are done to promote muscle lengthening. These are not to be confused with \u201cdynamic\u201d stretches. Dynamic stretches are stretches that are performed with movement and are best done prior to exercises. The dynamic hamstring stretch in your daily routine is one example. \nThe key muscles to maintain flexibility are the hamstrings, glutes, piriformis, and psoas. For each of the following four stretches, try to hold for forty-five to sixty seconds with an intensity of about a 6\/10. When performing the stretch, make sure that everything is relaxed except your arms, which are doing the work. Also maintain a light core brace to protect your back. Perform these stretches after exercise. \nHamstring Stretch\n\nStep 1: Get a belt, towel, or strap. It should about twice the length of your leg.\nStep 2: Lie on your back. Place the strap around your foot.\nStep 3: Find neutral spine and brace your core.\nStep 4: Slowly pull one leg up until you feel a moderate stretch (about a 6\/10 in intensity).\nStep 5: Hold for forty-five to sixty seconds. Make sure your arms and core are the only parts of your body working. Everything else should be relaxed.\nStep 6: Repeat on the other side. \nGlute Stretch\n\nStep 1: Lie on your back. Find neutral spine. Brace core lightly.\nStep 2: Cross one leg over the other.\nStep 3: Put your hands around the thigh of the uncrossed leg and use it as a lever to pull back the crossed leg, stretching the buttock.\nStep 4: Hold for forty-five to sixty seconds. Make sure that your arms and core are the only areas working. Everything else should be relaxed.\nStep 5: Repeat on other side. \nPiriformis Stretch\n\nStep 1: Lie on your back.\nStep 2: Find neutral spine and brace your core. Bend one knee and bring it toward your chest.\nStep 3: Grab the top\/outside of the foot of the bent leg with the opposite hand as shown.\nStep 4: With the other hand, grab the knee.\nStep 5: Pull the knee to the opposite shoulder, creating a stretch in the buttock area. \nStep 6: Hold for forty-five to sixty seconds. Make sure that your arms and core are the only areas working. Everything else should be relaxed.\nStep 7: Repeat on other side. \nPsoas Stretch\nThis stretch is slightly more difficult than the others. The goal is to feel a stretch in the top of the thigh, groin, and inside the abdominal wall.\n\nStep 1: Get in a half-kneeling position: One leg will be in front of you, knee bent, and foot on the floor. The other leg will be below you, knee bent, with lower leg and knee resting on the floor. \nStep 2: Find neutral spine and brace your core.\nStep 3: Shift your body forward by \u201cpointing\u201d your hip bone straight out in front of you while simultaneously squeezing the glutes on that side. You should maintain neutral spine, not round your back or hinge forward at the hips. \nStep 4: Bring your arms up over your head. You should feel the stretch in the thigh, groin, and\/or inner abdomen. Hold for forty-five to sixty seconds. Then switch sides.","output":"This chapter focuses on mobility and flexibility exercises to increase and maintain the range of motion in the hips and lower extrem"}

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to open a box sealed with epoxy:\n\n1. Safety first: Put on protective gear such as gloves, safety goggles, and a dust mask. Epoxy can be hazardous when inhaled or when it comes into contact with your skin.\n2. Gather tools: You'll need a heat gun, a thin flathead screwdriver, a utility knife or X-Acto knife, and some pliers.\n3. Apply heat: Using a heat gun, apply heat to the epoxy seal around the edges of the box. This will help soften the epoxy, making it easier to remove. Be cautious not to apply too much heat, as it could damage the box's contents or the box itself.\n4. Score the epoxy: Once the epoxy is softened, use the utility knife or X-Acto knife to carefully score along the seam where the epoxy meets the box. This will create a weak point in the epoxy, making it easier to pry open the box.\n5. Pry open the box: Use the flathead screwdriver to carefully pry open the box along the scored line. Start at one corner and work your way around the box. Be patient and gentle, as you don't want to damage the box or its contents.\n6. Remove excess epoxy: Once the box is open, use the pliers and utility knife to remove any remaining epoxy residue from the edges of the box.\n7. Clean the box: Use rubbing alcohol and a cloth to clean any remaining epoxy residue from the box.\n8. Inspect the contents: Check the contents of the box for any damage that may have occurred during the process.\n\nPlease be cautious while performing these steps, and if you are unsure or uncomfortable with this process, consult a professional."}

Evaluate the derivative at the x-coordinate of the point where f crosses the y-axis to find the slope of the tangent line.\n4. Use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the tangent line.\n5. Set the y-value of the tangent line equation to 0 and solve for x to find the x-intercept.\n\nStep 1: Find the coordinates of the point where f crosses the y-axis.\nThe graph of a function f(x) crosses the y-axis when x = 0. So, we need to find f(0):\nf(0) = (4*0 - 1)^2 \\* (3*0 + 2)^2 = (-1)^2 \\* (2)^2 = 1 \\* 4 = 4\n\nSo, the point where f crosses the y-axis is (0, 4).\n\nStep 2: Find the derivative of f(x).\nf(x) = (4x - 1)^2 \\* (3x + 2)^2\nApply the product rule and chain rule:\nf'(x) = 2(4x - 1)(4)(3x + 2)^2 + 2(3x + 2)(3)(4x - 1)^2\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the derivative at the x-coordinate of the point where f crosses the y-axis.\nf'(0) = 2(-1)(4)(2)^2 + 2(2)(3)(-1)^2 = -32 + 12 = -20\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line at the point (0, 4) is -20.\n\nStep 4: Use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the tangent line.\nThe point-slope form of a linear equation is: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nPlug in the slope m = -20, and the point (0, 4):\ny - 4 = -20(x - 0)\n\nSimplify:\ny = -20x + 4\n\nStep 5: Set the y-value of the tangent line equation to 0 and solve for x to find the x-intercept.\n0 = -20x + 4\n\nAdd 20x to both sides:\n20x = 4\n\nDivide by 20:\nx = 1\/5\n\nSo, the x-intercept of the tangent line to the graph of f at the point where the graph of f crosses the y-axis is x = 1\/5."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Could you define a Maple project by employing PDEtools package to solve a physical problem?","output":"Sure, here's an example of a Maple project that uses the PDEtools package to solve a physical problem:\n\nSuppose we want to study the heat distribution in a metal plate, assuming that the temperature is constant along its edges and that the plate is subject to a constant heat flux on one of its faces. This is a classical problem in the theory of heat conduction, and can be modeled by the following partial differential equation:\n\n\u2207\u00b2T = -Q\/k\n\nwhere T is the temperature distribution, Q is the heat flux, k is the thermal conductivity of the metal, and \u2207\u00b2 is the Laplace operator.\n\nTo solve this equation using Maple, we first need to define the problem geometry and the boundary conditions. We can do this using the PDEtools package as follows:\n```scss\nwith(PDEtools):\n\n# Define the rectangular plate and the coordinate system\nR := Rectangle([-1, -1], [1, 1]):\ncoords := [x, y]:\n\n# Define the boundary conditions\nbc := { T(x, -1) = 0, T(x, 1) = 0, T(-1, y) = 0, T(1, y) = 0, -k*diff(T(x,y),y) = Q, y=-1};\n```\nHere, we define a rectangular plate with dimensions [-1, 1] x [-1, 1] and a Cartesian coordinate system [x, y]. We then specify the boundary conditions: the temperature is constant and zero on all four edges of the plate, and on one of the faces there is a constant heat flux Q. The PDEtools package allows us to specify the boundary condition in a more general form, which includes the use of the diff function to represent partial derivatives.\n\nNext, we need to solve the PDE using the `pdsolve` function, which takes as input the PDE, the domain of the solution, and the boundary conditions. We can also specify the type of solution we want (e.g., series, numerical, etc.) and any additional options, such as the number of terms in the series expansion. For this example, we will use the default options for a series solution:\n```css\n# Define the PDE and solve for the temperature distribution\npde := laplacian(T(x, y), coords) = -Q\/k:\nsol := pdsolve(pde, bc, coords);\n```\nThe `laplacian` function is a shortcut provided by the PDEtools package for the Laplace operator. The `pdsolve` function returns a symbolic solution for the temperature distribution, which we can manipulate and plot using Maple's built-in functions. For example, we can plot the temperature distribution in the plate using the `plot3d` function:\n```scss\n# Plot the temperature distribution in the plate\nplot3d(rhs(sol), x=-1..1, y=-1..1, axes=boxed, labels=['x', 'y', 'T'], orientation=[-120, 30]);\n```\nThis will produce a 3D plot of the temperature distribution in the plate, which we can use to analyze the behavior of the heat conduction problem.\n\nOverall, this Maple project demonstrates how the PDEtools package can be used to model and solve physical problems involving partial differential equations. By defining the geometry and boundary conditions of the problem, we can use Maple to obtain a symbolic solution for the temperature distribution in the metal plate, which we can further analyze and visualize using Maple's built-in functions."}

{"instruction":"","input":"what is the thesis statement of this essay? give me an answer in 2 sentences: Outsider of Tea Culture\nEveryone is acquainted with tea. This is a household name that has a history of thousands of years. Chinese mythology aside, archeological evidence has been found indicating that tea was used as a medicine by the elite as early as the Han dynasty 206 BCE\u2013220 CE which is almost a thousand years ago (Meredith). Being from the generation of my great grandfather, my family also has a long history of sipping tea. Now, with the pace of people's lives getting faster and faster, a kind of \"instant tea\" came into being, like Lay's tea bag on the supermarket shelf. This kind of tea generally has a lot of flavors like lemon or peach flavor. People are gradually forgetting original tea cultures as society moves faster and faster. However, tea culture is a rich and diverse custom that has been practiced for centuries throughout the globe. From the ancient tea ceremonies of China and Japan to the bustling tea houses of India and the Middle East, tea has played a significant role in the social and cultural fabric of numerous societies. However, how many people know the culture or practices behind this familiar product? In other words, although I have been sipping tea for many years, I still regard myself as an outsider of this culture. (THESE STATEMENT)\nBefore we know what tea culture is, we should know what is culture? Raymond Williams calls culture \u201cone of the two or three most complicated words in the English language\u201d. First, culture can be used to refer to \u2018a general process of intellectual, spiritual and aesthetic development\u2019. A second use of the word \u2018culture\u2019 might be to suggest \u2018a particular way of life, whether of a people, a period or a group\u2019. Finally, Williams suggests that culture can be used to refer to \u2018the works and practices of intellectual and especially artistic activity\u2019(Williams 90). What is my definition of culture reflection with mine\nUnless you are in the environment mixed with the insider, otherwise definitely do not experience the so-called tea culture. Since it can be considered culture, it must have its spiritual connotation. In recent years, the word \"culture\" has become so prevalent that everything depends on culture. For example, people casually grab some tea at home, know nothing about what is thrown into the glass, and randomly pour boiling water down. Some might just take photos and post it with a prestigious word in social media and some might just swallow bottles of these liquids, and these are so-called \"tea culture\". \nAdmittedly, if we take a broad cultural perspective, we can't deny that this is not culture. When many of us use the word culture, we are outsiders. So what distinguishes us from the insiders and the outsiders, in other words what are the insiders of tea culture? From the characteristics of tea, it must be a few that can really touch the level of [culture]. Overall, the insider perspective of tea culture involves an understanding of the history, traditions, and values that are associated with tea in a particular region or culture, as well as the rituals and practices that have developed around the preparation, serving, and consumption of tea.The key word of \u201ctea culture\u201d in anthropologists\u2019 view of points is \u201cculture\u201d. As Wang Ling writes in her book: \u201cStudy of tea culture is not the study of the growth of tea cultivation, production, chemical components, pharmaceutical principles, function of health care, etc. These are the work of natural scientists. Our duty is to study the cultural and social phenomenon in the process of using tea\u201d (Ling 2013). Most people, though they have been drinking tea for decades, are simply a personal habit, far from the word \"insider\". \nI once went to a teahouse and experienced tea culture. Until today, I can still remember how I felt at that time. As soon as you enter the door, you can feel the strong smell of tea. The decoration in the store is elegant, simple and elegant. The clerk greeted me warmly and recommended black tea to me. I sat down and tasted this black tea, felt its mellow flavor, and enjoyed the tea culture and art works in the store. My mood gradually relaxed. The clerk told me that the black tea here comes from Fujian and is made from fresh buds when picking. The taste of tea is mellow and has a natural sweet taste. He also introduced me to the process of tea making and tea tasting methods, which made me have a deeper understanding of tea.\nIn the process of tea tasting, I found that there were also some tea ceremony and tea art performances in the teahouse, and the staff would also carry out some tea ceremony ceremonies with the guests. I was very interested, so I learned some basic tea ceremony rituals from the shop assistant, such as how to serve tea, how to taste tea, and so on. The tea teacher boiled the water in an iron pot, and then made tea in a ceramic pot and funnel. He brewed the tea several times until it unfolded and released its fragrance. I picked up the tea cup and smelled the fragrance of the tea. It exuded a light soil and wood flavor. Then, I took a sip. The taste was very special. It had a strong lingering charm, a little sour, sweet but not greasy, and slightly bitter. The tea soup is very thick and the taste is very smooth. The tea teacher said that this kind of tea can help to reduce fat, reduce fat and digest food. After drinking it, I feel much more comfortable in my stomach. While enjoying the fragrance of tea, I also watched the display of tea sets and tea art. There are various tea sets in the teahouse, including ceramics, silverware, glass and purple clay pots. The tea teacher demonstrated the traditional tea performance, including the technique of pouring tea soup from the pot and the method of tasting tea. In the tea ceremony, I felt a quiet, elegant and introverted beauty, and my mood became more peaceful.\nIn the teahouse, I also made some friends who like tea culture. We shared our love and experience of tea and exchanged our experiences and feelings. This makes me feel very warm, and the tea culture is also richer and more colorful because of this exchange. Not only making and tasting tea, but also communicating on the table is a kind of culture. Because sometimes the purpose of drinking tea is not only to drink, but also to promote communication and communication. From these disparate tea cultures, there are a few common themes that resonate with the tea drinkers of today. For the Chinese, Indians and Brits, tea was a way to bring people together. It was a shared experience and a chance to connect with other people.(Dwyer) Drinking tea can become a medium of communication, and places such as teahouses and teahouses are usually places for people to communicate. The brewing process of tea takes a certain amount of time, which can be used for chat and exchange. In the process of drinking tea, people can share each other's stories, experiences, feelings, or discuss some topics to enhance feelings and exchange ideas. Tea also helps to relieve physical and mental pressure, make people more relaxed and happy, and make it easier to carry out positive dialogue. At the same time, tea culture also brings a harmonious and peaceful atmosphere to people. In the teahouse, people usually maintain a quiet and elegant attitude, do not make noise, do not disturb others, and maintain a respectful attitude, which also helps the smooth communication.\nIn general, this experience of tea culture made me feel the charm and cultural connotation of tea, and made me like tea more. It not only makes me cherish the exchange and sharing between people more. Drinking tea is closely related to communication. Under the influence of tea culture, people can communicate more naturally and comfortably, and also enjoy the calm and harmonious atmosphere brought by tea culture.At the same time, I also deeply feel that as an outsider of tea culture. Although I have had a lot of tea at home since I was young, I have never known the specific technology and process of tea brewing and tasting. I have always thought that I am an insider, so I can be called an outsider. They are so unfamiliar with familiar things.","output":"The thesis statement of this essay is: \"Tea culture is a rich and diverse custom that has been practiced for centuries throughout the globe.

Methods mentioned include surveys, interviews, focus groups, participant observation, observations of public behavior, and the analysis of existing data. Topics include research on perception, cognition, motivation, identity, language, communication, cultural beliefs or practices, and social behavior.\n\nIn addition to explicitly identifying these methods, the regulations include provisions that allow for appropriate review of social sciences, humanities, and behavioral research. For example, the regulations:\n\nIdentify research activities that are low risk (for example, surveys in which no identifiers are collected), and that are exempt from some provisions of the regulations (such as the requirement for continuing review).\nIdentify research activities with no more than minimal risk that can be initially reviewed by one or more Institutional Review Board (IRB) members, rather than at a convened IRB meeting.\nAllow for waivers of the requirement to obtain written consent (for example, in a study of undocumented workers).\nInclude provisions that permit researchers to withhold information in the consent process. This provision is important when some degree of deception is required in order to obtain valid results.\nAllow for the amendment of approved study plans. This process can be used effectively when it is not possible to know at the outset how a study will evolve. An example would be field research.\nThis module provides an overview of the federal regulations, so researchers can become familiar with the basic provisions. The full text of the federal regulations is available online.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this module, you should be able to:\n\nDetermine whether proposed research meets the criteria for exemption.\nDescribe the criteria for the use of expedited review procedures and IRB review.\nSummarize the authority of an IRB.\nDescribe the kinds of review that approved research may need.\n45 CFR 46: Protection of Human Subjects\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations are sometimes referred to as 45 CFR 46, a label that identifies their location in the code of federal regulations.\n\nSubpart A of 45 CFR 46 is often referred to as the Common Rule. Although these regulations were first drafted and adopted by HHS, most federal departments and agencies that fund research in the social and behavioral sciences, including the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Education (ED) subsequently adopted the regulations as part of their own codes of federal regulations.\n\nThe Common Rule remained largely unchanged until 2017. In 2017, HHS with 15 other federal agencies issued a Final Rule to update the regulations. The revisions were designed to strengthen protections for human subjects, as well as reduce administrative burdens and add flexibility for the modern research environment. Major changes were made to requirements for IRB operations, informed consent, definitions, and exemptions.\n\nThe general compliance date for the revised Common Rule was 21 January 2019, and research approved, waived, or determined to be exempt is governed by the \u201c2018 Requirements\u201d version of the Common Rule. Ongoing research that was approved, waived, or determined to be exempt prior to 21 January 2019 can continue for its duration under the \u201cpre-2018 Requirements\u201d or be transitioned to the 2018 Requirements.\n\nThis module will refer to the 2018 Requirements version of the Common Rule, but it is important to understand which version of the regulation applies to which research, so it may be helpful to check with your organization and\/or the IRB of record for guidance.\n\nAdditional Protections for Vulnerable Subjects\nThree subparts (B, C, and D) were added to the basic provisions of the federal regulations to further protect vulnerable subjects in research:\n\no Subpart B: Pregnant women, human fetuses, and neonates\n o Subpart C: Prisoners\n o Subpart D: Children\n\nSome federal agencies that adopted the Common Rule also have adopted some or all of the other subparts of the HHS regulations, but others have not. For example, while the ED has adopted the additional protections for children, the NSF has not.\n\nAssurances with the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP)\nEvery institution conducting research with federal support is required to enter into an agreement called an \"assurance.\" Most assurances are filed with OHRP. An assurance identifies the regulations for protecting research subjects that the institution will abide by. In the U.S., this is the Common Rule.\n\nThe assurance only applies to studies that are funded by a Common Rule department or agency.\n\nSome institutions apply the Common Rule to all research regardless of the funding source. This means that the Common Rule would apply to research funded by foundations, associations, internal award programs, all other sources of research support, and even when research is not funded. However, the non-federally supported research would not be subject to OHRP oversight or the assurance.\n\nSome institutions also choose to apply the additional Subparts B, C, and D to all research regardless of the funding source. Others choose to apply the subparts only to federally funded research. Once again, this voluntary application of the regulations would not be part of the assurance.\n\nThe assurance also identifies the IRBs that will review research on behalf of the institution. According to the revised Common Rule, the institution will no longer have to list all the IRBs that it relies on through reliance agreements on the assurance.\n\nContent of the Federal Regulations\nPortions of the federal regulations most relevant for researchers include:\n\nWhat research must be reviewed\nWho must review research with human subjects\nWhat questions should be addressed during a review\nWhat kinds of review need to take place during the course of a project\nIt is important to note that the federal regulations are intended to provide minimum standards and may be supplemented by institutional policy.\n\nWhat Research Must Be Reviewed\nThe first step in deciding whether a project needs to be reviewed is to determine whether it meets the definition of research with human subjects. If it does not meet the definition, it does not require review by an IRB, although there may be ethical issues that must be addressed by the researcher's institution.\n\nThere are two critical definitions in 45 CFR 46.102.\n\n\"Research\" means a systematic investigation, including research development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.\n\n\u201cResearch\u201d\n\nDefined as \u201cNot Research\u201d\n\nSystematic investigation, including research development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.\n\nScholarly and journalistic activities (for example, oral history, journalism, biography, literary criticism, legal research, and historical scholarship)\n\nPublic health surveillance activities\n\nCollection and analysis of information, biospecimens, or records by or for a criminal justice agency for activities authorized by law or court order or criminal investigative purposes\n\nAuthorized intelligence, homeland security, defense, or national security mission operational activities\n\n\"Human subject\" means a living individual about whom a researcher (whether professional or student) conducting research:\n\nObtains information or biospecimens through intervention or interaction with the individual, and uses, studies, or analyzes the information or biospecimens; or\nObtains, uses, studies, analyzes, or generates identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens.\nIf it has been determined that a project meets the definition of research and includes human subjects, the next step is to determine the type of review it needs. The type of review usually determines who will conduct the review.\n\nResearch Eligible for Exemption\nOf significant interest to researchers in the social and behavioral sciences is the fact that there are activities that meet the definition of research with human subjects but are exempt from the provisions of the Common Rule. They do not require formal review as described in the regulations.\n\nMany institutions have created review procedures for making the determination that research is exempt.\n\nInstitutional procedures vary, but most commonly it is an agent of the institution, not the researcher, that makes the determination, because researchers have an inherent conflict of interest.\n\nResearch may be eligible for exemption from the regulations if all the activities associated with the research fall into one or more of eight categories. Of the eight categories, social, behavioral, and educational research typically falls into one of these:\n\nResearch conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings, involving normal educational practices.\nResearch only involving educational tests, survey procedures, interview procedures, or observation of public behavior, provided that at least one of these criteria is met:\nThe investigator records the information in such a way that subjects cannot be readily identified\nAny disclosure of identifiable information outside the research setting would not place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects\u2019 financial standing, employability, or reputation.\nThe investigator records the information and the subjects can be readily identified, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review.\nNote: If Subpart D applies, either by sponsor requirement or institutional choice, interviews, surveys, and participant observation with children as research subjects might not be exempt under Exempt Category 2 (there are specific restrictions for Exempt Category 2 research complying with Subpart D).\nResearch involving benign behavioral interventions in conjunction with the collection of information from an adult subject through verbal or written responses (including data entry) or audiovisual recording if the subject prospectively agrees to the intervention and information collection.\nSecondary research for which consent is not required.\nA complete list of research activities eligible for exemption is provided at 45 CFR 46.104.\n\nExpedited Review or Convened IRB Review\nIf research is not eligible for exemption, the remaining options are expedited review or convened IRB review for initial approval. Expedited review is conducted by one or more experienced IRB members. Convened IRB review is conducted by a quorum of the IRB.\n\nTo be eligible for expedited review for initial approval, research must meet criteria, including the following:\n\nPose no more than minimal risk to subjects\n\u201cMinimal risk\u201d means \u201cthe probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests\u201d (Protection of Human Subjects 2018).\n\nConsist of only one or more research activities specified in the federal regulations as eligible for expedited review (It may be helpful to review the Categories of Research That May Be Reviewed by the Institutional Review Board [IRB] through an Expedited Review Procedure).\nIf the primary risk to subjects is a breach of confidentiality and the risk can be managed to no more than minimal , then the research may be reviewed through an expedited process.\n\nThere are many research activities that are eligible for expedited review.\n\nIn addition to studies involving surveys, focus groups, interviews, and observations of behavior, studies involving the collection of biological samples and data by non-invasive means may be eligible for expedited review. Biological samples include saliva and fingernail cuttings or measures of pesticide exposure using skin patches. Data collected by non-invasive means includes galvanic skin response, heart rate, and blood pressure.\n\nA category of research activity eligible for expedited review includes the collection of blood samples within well-defined parameters based, for example, on the age of the research population.\n\nResearch involving identifiable data collected for non-research purposes may be eligible for expedited review as may the collection of existing data from voice, digital, or image recordings made for research purposes.\n\nInstitutional policy, local conditions, and subject vulnerability may require review by the convened IRB even for a study with no more than minimal risk, such as a study of individuals with impaired decision-making.\n\nIf research involves more than minimal risk and\/or does not fall into one of the categories of research eligible for expedited review, it must be reviewed by a convened IRB. This review involves consideration by a larger, more diverse group, thus bringing more perspectives and more experience to the review.\n\nWho must review research with human subjects?\nAs described in the federal regulations and implemented by institutional policy, there are three possible sets of reviewers.\n\nDescription of an IRB\nAn IRB is a review committee established to ensure that the rights and welfare of human research subjects are protected. Although federal regulations use the term IRB, institutions may choose a different name for the committee, such as Research Ethics Board or Independent Ethics Committee.\n\nMembership\nThe minimum size and required composition of an IRB is described in detail in the federal regulations. An IRB must have at least five members (including a person not otherwise affiliated with the institution, a scientist, and a non-scientist). The non-affiliated member can also be the non-scientist or scientist (the individual may be the same person fulfilling two requirements). Its membership must be diverse, including race, gender, and cultural background. The committee is expected to:\n\nBe sensitive to community attitudes\nHave knowledge and experience with vulnerable populations (persons potentially vulnerable to coercion or undue influence)\nBe conversant with applicable regulations, state and local laws, and standards of professional conduct\nThe most important requirement is that an IRB must have the expertise and professional competence to evaluate the research it reviews. One or more members must have familiarity with the discipline and methods under consideration. If not, the IRB must seek that expertise through consultation. For example, if an IRB reviews research on sensitive topics using web-based surveys, it must have expertise about security issues in the internet environment or seek outside consultation.\n\nAuthority of the IRB\nFederal regulations stipulate that an IRB can:\n\nApprove research\nDisapprove research\nRequire modifications to secure approval\nConduct continuing reviews\nSuspend or terminate approval\nObserve, or have a third party observe, the consent process and the research procedures\nAn IRB must notify researchers, in writing, about the outcome of its reviews, including modifications required to secure IRB approval of the research activity. If the IRB decides to disapprove a research activity, the written notification must provide the reasons for its decision and give the researcher an opportunity to respond in person or in writing.\n\nOther Institutional Reviews\nResearch approved by an IRB may be subject to additional review by institution officials, for example, department heads, deans, or research directors. The institution may decide that IRB-approved research may not take place. However, if an IRB has disapproved the research, the institution may not override that determination.\n\nWhat questions should be addressed during a review?\nExempt Research\nWhen research is exempt from the provisions of the Common Rule, it follows that the review criteria provided for expedited review and convened IRB review would not apply.\n\nFor most exempt determinations, an experienced staff member may make the determination for exemption. However, for limited IRB review, the determination must be made by an IRB member. Further, in the case of limited IRB review as a condition for exemption, the IRB reviewer must review the research per limited IRB review criteria and make the determinations required for limited IRB review.\n\nAll research should abide by the three basic ethical principles outlined in the Belmont Report: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. The principle of respect for persons would entail securing informed consent from research subjects.\n\nMany institutions have developed forms designed to gather sufficient information to determine not only that a project is exempt, but also that it will be conducted in accordance with the basic ethical principles.\n\nExpedited and IRB Review\n\nThe same questions must be asked when an IRB member is conducting an expedited review and when the convened IRB is conducting the review.\n\nHave the risks to subjects been minimized using procedures that are consistent with sound research design?\nAre the risks reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits?\nIs the selection of subjects equitable?\nAre adequate procedures in place to ensure privacy and confidentiality?\nIs there a plan to monitor the data and safety of the subjects, if necessary?\nWill informed consent be sought and appropriately documented? Do proposed alterations or waivers of informed consent meet the criteria for approval?\nAre safeguards in place to protect vulnerable populations?\nComparison of Expedited and Convened IRB Review\nReview procedures for expedited review and convened IRB review are similar in several ways:\n\nThe review criteria are the same.\nReviewers using the expedited review procedure or the convened IRB can request modifications to research plans and approve the plans.\nA key difference between the two processes is that expedited reviewers cannot disapprove a research plan. If an expedited reviewer thinks a research plan is not approvable, the plan must be submitted to the IRB for review.\n\nAnother very important difference is that research initially approved in accordance with expedited review does not need continuing review. By regulation, continuing review is also not required for research that is in data analysis only, or research that is accessing follow-up clinical data only (Protection of Human Subjects 2018). The IRB may determine otherwise, however, and require continuing review on a study-by-study basis and must document how requiring continuing review increases protection for human subjects participating in the research.\n\nThe institution may also require researchers to submit annual progress check-ins based on institutional policy.\n\nApproved Research: Additional Reviews\nOnce a research plan has received initial approval through expedited or convened IRB review procedures, additional reviews may be required.\n\nFor more than minimal risk research only (approved by an IRB), continuing review must be conducted at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less than once per year.\nFor all research, changes to approved research plans must be reviewed and approved before implementation.\nFor all research, reports of unanticipated problems involving risk to the research subjects or others also must be reviewed through procedures developed by the researcher's institution where the research is conducted.\nContinuing reviews and reviews of proposed amendments to approved research may be reviewed by the IRB or through expedited review procedures. The determination about what type of review is appropriate is based on a number of factors, including the level of risk and the extent of proposed changes. The IRB or the expediting reviewer(s) must determine that all the requirements for initial review continue to be satisfied.\n\nContinuing Review: Expedited or IRB Review?\nFederal regulations permit expedited review procedures to be used for continuing review if the initial review was conducted by a convened IRB under some specific conditions, such as: (1) when during the initial review the IRB determined that the research involves no more than minimal risk and no additional risks have been identified, or (2) where no subjects have been enrolled and no additional risks have been identified (OHRP 1998).\n\nIRB review is required for continuing review for active research studies that are greater than minimal risk and initially approved by the convened IRB.\n\nIf research that is more than minimal risk is only in data analysis or collecting follow-up clinical data from subjects, continuing review may not be required under the regulations, depending on if the research is subject to the pre-2018 Requirements or the 2018 Requirements version of the Common Rule.\n\nAmending Approved Research Plans\nChanges to approved research plans must be approved prior to their implementation. The federal regulations (Protection of Human Subjects 2018) state that expedited review procedures may be used to approve \"minor changes in previously approved research during the period (of one year or less) for which approval is authorized.\"\n\nWhat constitutes a \"minor\" change is not described in the regulations and therefore, will be a matter of institutional policy.\n\nReports of Unanticipated Risks or Harms\nInstitutions that have an assurance with the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) are required to develop written procedures for reporting and reviewing unanticipated problems involving risks or harms to research subjects.\n\nLimited IRB Review\nThere may be cases of research for which limited IRB review is a condition of exemption. Although not technically an expedited review, this limited review requires that the IRB reviewer determine that there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data, among other requirements for the condition of exemption (Protection of Subjects 2018). Continuing review is not required for exempt studies approved via limited IRB review.\n\nOther Issues\nThe federal regulations cover other issues not addressed in this module such as working with collaborators on cooperative research, international research (taking place in foreign countries), required record-keeping, and the suspension or termination of IRB-approved research.\n\nSBE Research as Clinical Trials\n\nResearch that meets the definition of a \u201cclinical trial\u201d is subject to additional regulatory requirements and policies (as applicable). For example, Common Rule governed clinical trials must post informed consent forms on a publicly available website; and, NIH-supported clinical trials have additional training requirements (such as good clinical practice) for key study personnel.\n\nSummary\nFederal regulations define which research activities require IRB review, the types of review, who conducts the review, and the criteria for approval. Because the federal regulations establish a minimum standard, it is important to check with your institution to find out if there are additional procedures and criteria.","output":"The message you submitted was too long, please reload the conversation and submit something shorter."}

I misunderstood the issue. After reviewing the `OutputTable` component, it seems that it is not properly configured to display the data you are passing from the `CSVUpload` component.\n\nThe table configuration in `OutputTable` component is expecting data with the following keys: `firstName`, `lastName`, `age`, `visits`, `status`, and `progress`. However, the data you are passing from `CSVUpload` component does not have these keys. The data has the structure of `BTBModelType`.\n\nTo fix the issue, you need to adjust the columns configuration in `OutputTable` component to match the structure of the data you are passing. For instance, if `BTBModelType` has the following structure:\n```ts\ninterface BTBModelType {\n    id: string;\n    name: string;\n    value: number;\n}\n```\nYou would need to update the columns configuration in the `OutputTable` component to match the keys in `BTBModelType`.

{"instruction":"","input":"Ok, we have an intro:\n\n\"The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. \nThe POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.\nSince the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.\n\nIn terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.\nHowever, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.\nIt is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.\nIn this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.\"\n\nIt can exceed the attention span of the reader.

It was his perfect little home, filled with all his favorite things like seeds, nuts, and a soft pillow. However, one day when Pedro went to snuggle up in his pillow, he realized it was missing. He searched every corner of his cozy little hole, but it was nowhere to be found.\n\nPanicking, Pedro ran to his best friend, Ben, another mouse who lived nearby. Ben suggested that they search the garage together to find the missing pillow. They scurried through the garage, searching high and low for the pillow, but to no avail. Just as they were about to give up, they heard a loud meow.\n\nIt was Soroush, the wild cat who lived in the garage, and he had Pedro's pillow in his mouth! Pedro and Ben quickly ran and hid, but Soroush had already spotted them. Soroush had always been a bit of a bully to the mice, so they knew they had to be careful.\n\nPedro and Ben came up with a plan to distract Soroush while they retrieved the pillow. Pedro bravely offered himself as bait and ran in the opposite direction of the pillow, luring Soroush away. While Soroush was busy chasing Pedro, Ben snuck up and grabbed the pillow from under the cat's paws.\n\nSafely back in his cozy hole, Pedro snuggled up in his soft pillow and thanked Ben for his help. They both breathed a sigh of relief knowing that Soroush wasn't going to bully them anymore.\n\nFrom that day on, Pedro and Ben made sure to keep a closer eye on their belongings, and they even made sure to keep a safe distance from Soroush. Despite the scary encounter, they knew they could always count on each other to help when needed."}
{"instruction":"","input":"My sink is leaking. What should I check?","output":"A leaking sink can be caused by various issues. To identify and fix the problem, follow these steps:\n\n1. Turn off the water supply: Before you start investigating the leak, turn off the water supply to your sink by locating the shutoff valves under the sink and turning them clockwise.\n2. Identify the leak source: Inspect the sink to locate the source of the leak. Common areas to check include the faucet, drain, water supply lines, and the sink basin itself.\n3. Faucet leaks: If the leak is coming from the faucet, it could be caused by a worn-out or damaged cartridge, O-ring, or gasket. Disassemble the faucet, check for any damaged parts, and replace them as needed. Reassemble the faucet and test it to see if the leak has stopped.\n4. Drain leaks: If the leak is coming from the drain, check the drain assembly for loose connections or damaged seals. Tighten any loose connections, and replace any damaged seals, such as the rubber gasket under the drain flange or the plumber's putty around the flange.\n5. Water supply line leaks: Inspect the water supply lines for any signs of leakage. Check for loose connections at the shutoff valves and the faucet. Tighten any loose connections, and replace any damaged lines or washers.\n6. Sink basin leaks: If the leak is coming from the sink basin itself, it could be due to a crack or hole in the sink material. In this case, you may need to replace the sink entirely.\n7. Re-test: Once you've addressed the suspected cause of the leak, turn the water supply back on and check to see if the leak has stopped. If the leak persists, you may need to consult a professional plumber for further assistance."}

{"instruction":"","input":"I would like my asp.net core api proxy requests to another endpoint, how to best do this?","output":"To create an ASP.NET Core API that proxies requests to another endpoint, you can use the `HttpClient` class to forward incoming requests to the target API. Here's an example of how to do this:\n\n1. Create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project:\n```javascript\ndotnet new webapi -n MyApiProxy\ncd MyApiProxy\n```\n1. Add the `Microsoft.Extensions.Http` NuGet package:\n```java\ndotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Http\n```\n1. Open the `Startup.cs` file, and add the following using statements:\n```csharp\nusing System.Net.Http;\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;\n```\n1. In the `ConfigureServices` method, add the `HttpClient` service:\n```csharp\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\n{\n    services.AddControllers();\n    services.AddHttpClient();\n}\n```\n1. Create a new controller called `ProxyController.cs` in the `Controllers` folder and add the following code:\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Net.Http;\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\n\nnamespace MyApiProxy.Controllers\n{\n    [ApiController]\n    [Route(\"[controller]\")]\n    public class ProxyController : ControllerBase\n    {\n        private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;\n        private const string TargetApiBaseUrl = \"https:\/\/target-api.example.com\";\n\n        public ProxyController(HttpClient httpClient)\n        {\n            _httpClient = httpClient;\n        }\n\n        [HttpGet(\"{*path}\")]\n        public async Task<IActionResult> Get(string path)\n        {\n            var requestUri = new Uri(new Uri(TargetApiBaseUrl), path);\n\n            using var httpResponse = await _httpClient.GetAsync(requestUri);\n            httpResponse.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();\n\n            var content = await httpResponse.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync();\n\n            return new FileStreamResult(content, httpResponse.Content.Headers.ContentType.ToString());\n        }\n\n        \/\/ Add additional methods (POST, PUT, DELETE) if needed.\n    }\n}\n```\nMake sure to replace `https:\/\/target-api.example.com` with the actual URL of the target API.\n\nThis example sets up a simple proxy that forwards all incoming GET requests to the specified target API. You can add support for other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) by adding corresponding action methods in the `ProxyController` class.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a simple example and may not cover all use cases. For more complex scenarios or for better performance, consider using a dedicated reverse proxy server like NGINX or a library like YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy) for ASP.NET Core."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Which method performs confirming a purchase order in X++?","output":"In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations, you can confirm a purchase order using the `confirmOrder` method in X++. This method is part of the `PurchFormLetter` class, which is used to handle purchase order-related tasks.\n\nHere is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to confirm a purchase order using the `confirmOrder` method:\n```scss\nPurchFormLetter purchFormLetter;\nPurchTable purchTable;\n\n\/\/ Retrieve the purchase order to be confirmed\npurchTable = PurchTable::find('PO000123');\n\n\/\/ Initialize the PurchFormLetter object\npurchFormLetter = PurchFormLetter::construct(DocumentStatus::PurchaseOrder);\n\n\/\/ Set the purchase order as the document to be processed\npurchFormLetter.update(purchTable);\n\n\/\/ Confirm the purchase order\npurchFormLetter.confirmOrder();\n```\nIn this example, we first retrieve the purchase order to be confirmed using the `find` method of the `PurchTable` class. We then create a new instance of the `PurchFormLetter` class and initialize it to process a purchase order (using the `construct` method). Next, we set the purchase order to be processed using the `update` method of the `PurchFormLetter` class. Finally, we confirm the purchase order using the `confirmOrder` method of the `PurchFormLetter` class.\n\nNote that this is just one example of how to confirm a purchase order in X++.

Here are the basic rules you can follow:\n\nNumber of Players:\n------------------\n\n2-6\n\nDeck:\n-----\n\nOne standard deck of 52 cards, without jokers.\n\nObjective:\n----------\n\nThe objective of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards by forming valid sets and runs.\n\nSetup:\n------\n\n* Shuffle the deck and deal 7 cards to each player.\n* Place the remaining cards in a face-down deck.\n\nGameplay:\n---------\n\n* The player to the left of the dealer goes first, and then play moves clockwise.\n* Each player's turn consists of two parts: drawing and discarding.\n* The player starts their turn by drawing one card from the deck or the top card from the discard pile.\n* The player can then form sets and runs by either using cards from their hand or adding cards to existing sets and runs on the table.\n* A set consists of three or four cards of the same rank, but different suits.\n* A run consists of three or more cards of the same suit in sequential order (e.g., 3-4-5 of hearts).\n* The player can also choose to lay off cards to existing sets and runs on the table, but only if they have a valid card to contribute to the set or run.\n* The player ends their turn by discarding one card from their hand face-up on top of the discard pile.\n* If a player has formed sets and\/or runs that use all the cards in their hand, they can declare \"Rummy\" and lay down all their cards on the table to win the game.\n* If the deck runs out of cards, the game continues without drawing, and players must use only the cards in their hand.\n* If no player has declared \"Rummy\" and a player runs out of cards, they win the game.\n\nScoring:\n--------\n\n* At the end of the game, each player scores points for the cards they have left in their hand.\n* Face cards (Kings, Queens, Jacks) are worth 10 points each, and all other cards are worth their face value.\n* The winner of the game scores the difference between their score and the total of all the other players' scores.\n\nI hope this helps you create a fun and exciting Rummy-based card game!

Provide a variety of paintbrushes in different sizes and shapes to encourage experimentation.\n4. Encourage your child to use her favorite colors, such as pink and purple, and let her be as creative as she wants.\n5. Help her to understand that the paint needs to be applied in thin layers and to wait for each layer to dry before applying the next.\n6. Once the painting is complete, glaze and fire the pottery according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n7. Consider taking a pottery class together as it can be a fun and educational bonding experience."}

Show empathy: Try to put yourself in the other person's shoes, and acknowledge their feelings. Use phrases like \"I can understand how you feel\" or \"That sounds really tough.\"\n4. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume you know how the other person feels, or what they need. Instead, ask them to share their thoughts and feelings with you.\n5. Practice mindfulness: Being mindful of your own emotions and reactions can help you better understand and respond to the emotions of others.\n6. Learn about emotions and empathy: Read books, articles, and blogs on emotional intelligence, empathy, and effective communication.\n7. Seek feedback: ask people you interact with how they felt during the interaction and how they think you could improve your empathetic communication.\n8.

{"instruction":"","input":"What are some alternatives to Gaussian distributions in robotics?","output":"There are several alternatives to Gaussian distributions that can be used in robotics, depending on the specific application and requirements. Some of these alternatives include:\n\n1. Multimodal distributions: These distributions have multiple peaks or modes, which can be useful for modeling complex or diverse data. Examples include the mixture of Gaussians model and the von Mises-Fisher distribution.\n2. Student's t-distributions: These distributions have heavier tails than Gaussian distributions, which can be useful for modeling data with outliers or heavy-tailed noise.\n3. Laplace distributions: These distributions have a sharper peak and heavier tails than Gaussian distributions, which can be useful for modeling data with sparse outliers.\n4. Cauchy distributions: These distributions have even heavier tails than Laplace distributions, which can be useful for modeling data with extreme outliers.\n5. Exponential distributions: These distributions have a single peak and a long tail, which can be useful for modeling data with a low probability of extreme values.\n6. Poisson distributions: These distributions are discrete and are used to model counts or frequencies. They have a single peak and are often used in robotics for tasks such as object tracking or occupancy mapping.\n7. Bernoulli distributions: These distributions are also discrete and are used to model binary data (i.e., data that can only take on two values). They have a single peak and are often used in robotics for tasks such as decision-making and control."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Please write up a short summery about the proposed project base up information below: SPECIFIC AIMS:\nMedication adherence (MA), defined as the extent to which patients follow provider recommendations about day-to-day treatment with respect to the timing, dosage, and frequency,1 is a serious challenge for breast cancer (BC) patients undergoing endocrine therapy (ET). ET, including suppression of ovarian function (OFS), tamoxifen (TAM) and aromatase inhibitors (AI), is an adjuvant therapy used in more than 75% of early-stage BC with hormone receptor positive tumors (HR +). ET is essential for patients with HR+ tumors to reduce cancer recurrence and avoid early death.2, 3 Current practice guidelines recommend ET therapy for 5 to 10 years in HR+ patients.4, 5 However, the long duration of use and coupled with side effects of ET are associated with a high rate of nonadherence and early discontinuation of treatment. The rate of non-adherence ET in this population is 11%-25% at 12 months 6 and 41-72% at 5 years7, 8. Adverse side effects related to ET, that is, endocrine symptoms, such as hot flashes (HF) and arthralgia, have been identified as the main contributing factors to the nonadherence of ET,9 that significantly decrease quality of life (QOL). Other factors include lack of social support, poor patient-provider relationship, and low self-efficacy.10, 11 Meanwhile, studies have found that ET treatment-emergent symptoms identified by certain patient-reported outcomes (PRO) are associated with a greater risk of non-adherence and discontinuing of ET.6, 12 However, many strategies have so far failed to identify an effective intervention to manage ET-induced symptoms while improving ET adherence.13-17 \nAcupuncture is a therapy that uses fine needles to stimulate the peripheral and central nervous systems. Acupuncture has been found to reduce multiple symptoms associated with cancer therapies such as cancer pain, nausea, neuropathy, and fatigue.18, 19 Especially, previous studies have suggested that acupuncture reduces hot flashes and arthralgia in patients undergoing ET, with persistent results up to 12 months.20-24 Therefore, acupuncture has been recommended for arthralgia and hot flashes.25, 26 Our recent multinational study further demonstrated that acupuncture effectively reduces hot flashes and other endocrine symptoms in Asian and white patients.27, 28 In particular, we found that our acupuncture intervention significantly improved PRO measures that are specifically associated with ET adherence. Furthermore, previous studies also found that acupuncture care for patients with chronic diseases is a complex intervention that aims to generate a positive therapeutic alliance (TA), 29 30 which has also been associated with MA.31-35 However, the impact of acupuncture on endocrine symptoms among African Americans is less studied, and the use of acupuncture as a strategy to improve adherence to ET in patients with BC has not been investigated. \nAs part of a broader strategy to study the use of acupuncture to improve ET adherence, we plan to conduct a future fully powered pragmatic randomized trial evaluating the effectiveness of acupuncture to reduce nonadherence of ET medications in patients with BC. Our findings in BC could be used to inform strategies in other populations with chronic conditions that require long-term use of medications. Our general hypothesis is that applying acupuncture in the initial stages of ET will lead to a reduction in the non-adherence rate in BC patients. To inform the feasibility and design of a future large-scale trial, in this R01 application, we propose a mixed-methods, multisite feasibility clinical trial, collaborating with Henry Ford Health in Detroit, Michigan. In Phase I, we will: a) use a Delphi consensus approach to develop a TA-enhanced acupuncture protocol specific to HF and pain-related outcomes in BC; b) recruit and train a team of practitioners and assess the fidelity of the delivery of the intervention across two study sites; and c) establish infrastructure and protocols for data collection for a multisite clinical trial. In Phase II, we will conduct a pilot study with 60 BC patients who start ET randomized (1:1) to one of two arms: 16 sessions of acupuncture over 24 weeks plus enhanced usual care (EUC); or EUC, that is, usual care with education on adherence to ET. This study will allow us to address the following aims: \nSpecific Aim 1: To develop a TA-enhanced acupuncture protocol and train a team to deliver it with fidelity. We will recruit an expert panel that includes acupuncturists and oncologists to finalize the design of the acupuncture protocol. We will train 8 hospital-based practitioners to provide acupuncture care and systematically assess the fidelity of treatment at two sites. \nSpecific Aim 2: Assess the feasibility of a pilot randomized trial of ET adherence in patients with BC. We will evaluate the feasibility of recruiting and retaining multiracial BC patients undergoing ET and assess the adherence to the predefined intervention and evaluation \/ data collection schedules. The main clinical outcomes of interest include the prevalence of ET medication use at the end of the study (12 months after the initiation of ET), using a pharmacy database, pain severity, HF, and quality of life. \nSpecific Aim 3: Assess expectations and treatment experience. We will employ mixed methods with exit interviews to explore participant expectations and experiences, including facilitators and barriers to participation, and general treatment experience to inform our PRO battery.","output":"The proposed project aims to study the use of acupuncture to improve medication adherence in breast cancer patients undergoing endocrine therapy. Adherence to endocrine therapy is a challenge, with high rates of nonadherence and early discontinuation due to adverse side effects such as hot flashes and arthralgia.

The proposed study plans to conduct a mixed-methods, multisite feasibility clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture in reducing nonadherence to endocrine therapy medications in patients with breast cancer.

{"instruction":"","input":"Explain quantum computing in simple terms","output":"Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. In classical computing, data is stored as bits, which can have the value of 0 or 1. In quantum computing, data is stored as quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states at the same time. This property allows quantum computers to perform certain types of calculations much faster than classical computers. The most famous example of such a calculation is Shor's algorithm, which can factorize large integers exponentially faster than the best known classical algorithm. However, quantum computing is still a relatively new field and it is not yet clear what other types of problems can be solved faster on a quantum computer, or when practical, large-scale quantum computers will be built."}

Dried mushrooms are a fantastic ingredient to have in your kitchen arsenal, and I'm happy to share some of their uses with you.\n\n1. Flavoring Stocks and Broths: Dried mushrooms are a great addition to stocks and broths because they add a depth of flavor and richness that fresh mushrooms don't provide. Simply add the dried mushrooms to the pot and let them simmer along with the other ingredients.\n2. Enhancing Sauces and Gravies: Dried mushrooms can be rehydrated and added to sauces and gravies for an extra burst of flavor. They work particularly well in cream sauces, mushroom gravies, and red wine sauces.\n3. Making Mushroom Powder: Dried mushrooms can be ground into a powder and used as a seasoning. This is a great way to add mushroom flavor to dishes without the texture of actual mushrooms. Mushroom powder is particularly good in soups, stews, and casseroles.\n4. Adding Texture to Dishes: Dried mushrooms can be rehydrated and used in dishes where you want a meaty texture. For example, they work well in vegetarian stews, ragouts, and pasta sauces.\n5. Making Infused Oil: Dried mushrooms can be used to make infused oil. Simply add the dried mushrooms to a bottle of olive oil and let it sit for a few weeks. The resulting oil can be used as a finishing oil for dishes like risottos, pasta dishes, and salads.\n\nOverall, dried mushrooms are a versatile ingredient that can add depth and richness to a wide variety of dishes.

Preliminary estimates show roadway deaths \nclimbing to 42,915 in 2021, a 16 year high. Every day, about 32 people in the United States die in \ndrunk-driving 9 crashes \u2014 that's one person every 45 minutes. In 2020, 11,654 people died in alcohol-\nimpaired driving traffic deaths \u2014 a 14% increase from 2019 (NHTSA Media, 2022). \nThe ability of law enforcement to identify impaired drivers is a critical component to reducing fatalities \ninvolving alcohol and\/or drug impairment. Impaired driving is a human factor that must be addressed \nto overcome the vision zero challenge to eliminate all fatalities and serious injuries on our nations\u2019 \nroadways. This aligns with DOT\u2019s Strategic Goal of Safety. The effects of alcohol on an individual have \nbeen researched extensively and law enforcement are trained to identify signs and symptoms \nassociated with alcohol impairment through the basic Standardized Field Sobriety Testing curriculum, \noften included in the basic police academy\/certification course. Law enforcement officials may later \nreceive advanced training in the identification of impairment through the 16-hour Advanced Roadside \nImpaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) curriculum provided through the Drug Evaluation and \nClassification Program (DECP). Due to the complexity that comes with drug use and impairment, ARIDE\nis designed to introduce law enforcement officers to the identification of signs and symptoms \nassociated with impairment from drugs other than (or in addition to) alcohol. The ARIDE curriculum \nalso identifies the practical use of a Drug Recognition Expert, post-arrest, in Driving Under the \nInfluence of Drugs (DUID) cases. \nThere is a need to make impaired driving training as realistic as practical so law enforcement can \nensure they are identifying and apprehending impaired drivers\u2019 roadside. There are limitations and \nlegitimate concerns (such as liability and harm) with dosing live individuals with impairing substances \nfor the purpose of curriculum development. This project aims to reduce unnecessary risks of harm to \nindividuals. Additionally, we aim to reduce monetary costs and time involved in dosing individuals for \nthe purpose of training. \nThis topic aims to develop a course structure and technological approach for the purposes of training \nlaw enforcement on the behaviors associated with impaired driving. To achieve this, it is expected that\nsubject matter expertise in the areas of drug-impaired driving enforcement will inform the training \napproach and material. Ideally, these subject matter experts (SMEs) should be drug recognition \nexperts (DRE); drug recognition expert instructors; or drug recognition expert state coordinators who \nare familiar with the content and application of the DECP. The proposal should explain when this \nexpertise will be introduced into the project and, when possible, by whom. \nExpected Phase I Outcomes \nExpected outcomes for the conclusion of Phase I are a \u201cProof of Concept\u201d Final Report which presents \na course design for the interactive training technology and describes the technological approach and \nsoftware and hardware requirements. The project should also produce a detailed plan for the \ndevelopment of the software files for a wide variety of virtual drivers (varying by age, gender, race, \nethnicity) that can be displayed as under the influence of various impairing drugs, combinations of \ndrugs, and control subjects. Finally, the project outcomes must include the identification of \nqualifications required (i.e., DRE Instructor) to proctor the use of the interactive training technology. A \nproctoring instructor should be well versed in the field of DUID and current DUID curricula used to train\nlaw enforcement nationwide. \nExpected Phase II Outcomes \nConditional on the outcomes of Phase I, Phase II will begin development of a market ready device for \nuse by law enforcement officers. This device will be tested using the development plan developed in \"","output":"Dear NHTSA,\n\nWe at ForgeFX Training Simulations are excited to submit our proposal for the development of an immersive virtual reality training program on impaired driving for law enforcement.

If the user does not want to change their password, they can leave the password fields empty. The `clean()` method checks that the two password fields match, and the `clean_email()` method ensures that the email address is unique.\n\nThe `ProfileEditView` is a subclass of Django's built-in `UpdateView` and includes the logic to save changes to the user's profile.

This could include providing step-by-step instructions for solving a problem, demonstrating various techniques with visuals or suggesting online resources for further study. My first request is \u201cI need help understanding how probability works.\u201d","output":"Probability is a measure of how likely an event is to occur. It is usually expressed as a number between 0 and 1, with 0 representing an impossible event and 1 representing a certain event. For example, the probability of flipping a coin and getting heads is 0.5, because there is an equal chance of getting either heads or tails.\n\nThere are several different ways to calculate probability, but one common method is to use the formula:\n\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes \/ Total number of outcomes\n\nFor example, if you were rolling a die and wanted to know the probability of rolling a 4, the number of favorable outcomes would be 1 (there is only 1 way to roll a 4) and the total number of outcomes would be 6 (there are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a die). So, the probability of rolling a 4 would be 1\/6, or about 0.17.\n\nProbability can also be expressed as a percentage. To convert a probability to a percentage, simply multiply the probability by 100. For example, the probability of rolling a 4 on a die is about 0.17, which is equal to 17% when expressed as a percentage.\n\nI hope this helps!

The `moveSpeed` and `jumpForce` variables are public so you can adjust them in the Inspector. They control how fast the player moves horizontally and how high they jump.\n2. In the `Start()` method, we get a reference to the player's `Rigidbody2D` component.\n3. In the `Update()` method, we handle keyboard input for left\/right movement and jumping. When the player presses the left or right arrow keys, the script sets the player's horizontal velocity accordingly. When the player presses the space key and is currently grounded, the script adds a vertical impulse to the player's rigidbody to make them jump.\n4. In the `OnCollisionEnter2D()` method, we detect when the player touches the ground and set the `isGrounded` flag accordingly.\n5. Finally, there is a placeholder for ducking code, which you can fill in with your own implementation.\n\nNote that this is just a sample script and you may need to modify it to fit your specific game requirements."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Is there a difference between high school graduation gown\/cap and college gown\/cap if they are the same color?","output":"Yes, there are differences between high school graduation gowns\/caps and college graduation gowns\/caps, even if they are the same color. The differences are primarily in the style and design of the gown and cap.\n\nHigh school graduation gowns are typically designed to be simpler and more traditional, with a closed front and long, pointed sleeves. The cap is also usually a standard mortarboard style, with a flat square top and a tassel attached to the center. The color of the gown and cap may vary depending on the school's tradition or colors.\n\nCollege graduation gowns, on the other hand, are more elaborate and varied in design. The gown is typically open at the front, with a split and lapels, and may have a hood in the back to signify the field of study or degree earned. The cap is often a tam or a mortarboard with a longer tassel. The color of the gown and cap may also vary depending on the school's tradition or colors, but they are often more standardized across institutions.\n\nSo even if high school and college gowns\/caps are the same color, there are still differences in their design that set them apart."}
{"instruction":"","input":"Compare and contrast different database management systems and their applications in organizations.Answer in 15 m Style.Long Form Answer. High Detail. Apt Headings. Refer IT for Managers Subject.","output":"Introduction:\nIn today's digital world, data has become an essential asset for organizations. Effective management of data is crucial for businesses to make informed decisions, streamline operations, and gain a competitive advantage. This has led to the development of various database management systems (DBMS) that store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently. In this essay, we will compare and contrast different DBMS and their applications in organizations.\n\nRelational Database Management System (RDBMS):\nRDBMS is the most widely used database management system. It organizes data in tables, with each table consisting of rows and columns. It offers features such as data integrity, referential integrity, and SQL support. RDBMS is widely used in industries such as finance, healthcare, and retail, where there is a need to store structured data. It is used to store transactional data, such as customer orders and employee records, and is suitable for applications that require complex queries and reporting.\n\nObject-Oriented Database Management System (OODBMS):\nOODBMS stores data in objects, which are instances of classes. It offers features such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it suitable for applications that require complex data modeling. OODBMS is widely used in applications such as computer-aided design (CAD), scientific research, and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNoSQL Database Management System:\nNoSQL DBMS is designed to handle large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data. It offers features such as scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance, making it suitable for applications that require horizontal scaling. NoSQL DBMS is widely used in industries such as social media, e-commerce, and gaming, where there is a need to store unstructured data, such as user-generated content and clickstream data.\n\nComparison of Different DBMS:\nRDBMS, OODBMS, and NoSQL DBMS differ in their data models, features, and applications. RDBMS is suitable for applications that require structured data, complex queries, and reporting. OODBMS is suitable for applications that require complex data modeling, such as CAD and AI. NoSQL DBMS is suitable for applications that require scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance, such as social media, e-commerce, and gaming.\n\nAdvantages of DBMS:\n\n1. Improved data sharing: DBMS allows multiple users to access the same data concurrently, improving collaboration and data sharing.\n2. Data security: DBMS offers features such as authentication, authorization, and access control, ensuring data security.\n3. Data consistency: DBMS offers features such as referential integrity and data validation, ensuring data consistency.\n4. Reduced data redundancy: DBMS eliminates data redundancy, reducing data storage costs.\n5. Improved data backup and recovery: DBMS offers features such as backup and recovery, ensuring data availability in case of disasters.\n\nDisadvantages of DBMS:\n\n1. High cost: DBMS can be expensive to purchase and maintain, especially for small businesses.\n2. Complexity: DBMS can be complex to install, configure, and use, requiring specialized knowledge and training.\n3. Performance overhead: DBMS can introduce performance overhead, such as increased disk I\/O and CPU usage.\n4. Single point of failure: DBMS can be a single point of failure, making it vulnerable to downtime and data loss.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, different DBMS have different data models, features, and applications. RDBMS is suitable for structured data, OODBMS for complex data modeling, and NoSQL DBMS for unstructured and semi-structured data. DBMS offers advantages such as improved data sharing, data security, data consistency, reduced data redundancy, and improved data backup and recovery. However, it also has disadvantages such as high cost, complexity, performance overhead, and single"}

{"instruction":"","input":"Let us return to the text from cycle A for the readings at the Catholic Mass on Palm Sunday. Remember this event takes place in the season of Lent according to the liturgical calendar. How do you think this event takes place now here on earth when celebrated by Christians as far as it relates to the coming of Jesus Christ and ushering in his Kingdom on earth?","output":"When Christians celebrate the events of Palm Sunday during the season of Lent, they are participating in a rich liturgical tradition that helps to bring the story of Christ's life, death, and resurrection to life in a very tangible way. By waving palm branches and singing \"Hosanna!\" along with the crowds in Jerusalem, Christians today can reenact and participate in the triumphal entry of Jesus into the holy city, and can experience something of the joy and excitement that his followers must have felt at that time.\n\nAt the same time, however, the celebration of Palm Sunday also serves as a reminder of the ultimate purpose of Christ's coming, which was to establish God's Kingdom on earth and to bring salvation to all people. The humble and self-emptying example of Christ, who rode into Jerusalem on a donkey rather than a warhorse, serves as a powerful symbol of the values of love, peace, and humility that should guide our lives as Christians. And the fact that Jesus was ultimately rejected, arrested, and crucified by the authorities in Jerusalem reminds us of the cost of discipleship, and of the suffering and sacrifice that we may be called to endure in order to follow Christ.\n\nIn this way, the celebration of Palm Sunday during Lent can be seen as a microcosm of the Christian life as a whole, in which we are called to walk in the footsteps of Christ, humbly serving others and bearing witness to the truth, even in the face of opposition and persecution. And it reminds us that, even as we walk this difficult and often challenging path, we do so with the hope and confidence that comes from knowing that Christ has triumphed over sin and death, and that his Kingdom will ultimately be established in its fullness on earth."}

The function first solves the equation 4x - 7y + 9 = 0 for y, which gives y = (4x + 9) \/ 7.\n2. The function then checks if y is an integer between 0 and 20. If it is, the function returns y as an integer. If it's not, the function returns `None`.\n\nNote that the `is_integer()` method checks if a number is an integer, and returns `True` if it is and `False` if it's not. Also, the `int()` function is used to convert a float to an integer, which is necessary because the result of the equation may be a float."}

{"instruction":"","input":"I currently operate a US-based housing company dedicated to providing traveling students and interns with semesterly housing. We operate a rental arbitrage model, wherein we rent an entire home or apartment unit, furnish the home or unit and then sublet it by the bedroom to student and interns. We are hoping to expand internationally, and would like your help in identifying the best city to open our next 10 homes in, taking into account the startup cost and legal barriers to such international expansion","output":"Expanding internationally can be a great opportunity for your business. When considering the best city to open your next 10 homes in, you should take into account several factors, such as demand, cost of living, local regulations, and potential competition.\n\nBased on these factors, here are five cities to consider for your expansion:\n\n1. London, United Kingdom:\nLondon is a popular destination for international students and interns, with numerous prestigious universities and companies based in the city. The UK generally has a robust legal system and a relatively straightforward process for setting up a business. However, London has a high cost of living, and the competition in the housing market can be fierce.\n2. Berlin, Germany:\nBerlin is a thriving city with a growing startup scene, attracting students and interns from around the world. The cost of living in Berlin is lower than in London, and the rental market is more accessible. Germany has well-established regulations for rental properties, and you may need to navigate some bureaucracy when setting up your business.\n3. Toronto, Canada:\nToronto is a diverse city with a strong demand for student and intern housing due to its many universities and businesses. The cost of living is relatively high, but Canada has a stable legal system and a favorable environment for startups. Be prepared for competition in the housing market, and research local regulations related to rental properties.\n4. Barcelona, Spain:\nBarcelona is an attractive destination for international students and interns due to its pleasant climate, rich culture, and relatively low cost of living. The city has a strong demand for housing, but local regulations may be more challenging to navigate. Be prepared to invest time in understanding Spanish rental laws and business regulations.\n5. Sydney, Australia:\nSydney is a popular destination for students and interns, boasting several world-renowned universities and a thriving business scene. The cost of living is high, but the legal framework for businesses is well-established and relatively straightforward. Research local rental regulations and be prepared for competition in the housing market.\n\nWhen expanding to a new city, you should consider factors such as the local demand for housing, the cost of living, and the ease of setting up a business. Additionally, keep in mind that local regulations and legal barriers can differ significantly between countries, and it is crucial to understand these differences before committing to a specific location. It is recommended to consult with local legal and real estate experts to help you make the best decision for your business expansion."}

They are fundamentally different from other fintechs, offering high-value loans instead of micro-credits, strong collateral instead of factoring, and funding initially from deposits instead of institutional debt.\n\nThe Problem\n-----------\n\nThe oligopolistic nature of the Latin American banking industry has resulted in no pressure to innovate and expand the market. LATAM has the lowest financial inclusion while banks have the highest returns. Additionally, informal loans are three times larger than the formal market, and 30% of SMEs in LATAM lack access to formal credit, which has a major impact. Latin Americans have access to shorter terms, and early payments decrease the effective maturity term.\n\nThe Opportunity\n---------------\n\nSureti aims to drive financial inclusion by unlocking the value of assets worth $900 billion. The TAM loan market is $3,800 billion in LATAM, and the company aims to provide financial inclusion for 30% of the need for working capital. Home equity loans are calculated based on Colombian figures and each country's population and credit access. SAM has $206 billion, and the home-backed loans are $169 billion, while other assets are $37 billion.\n\nThe Solution\n------------\n\nSureti has created a system to mortgage and disburse the loan within 10 days. The company offers a best-in-class app that operates loans 30% more efficiently. Sureti has a unique model for deposits that allows people to invest and earn monthly returns. The company has digitized the analysis of the asset history and current asset status, which eliminated origination costs.\n\nTraction & Validation\n---------------------\n\nSureti's monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is the difference between the interest paid by each loan and the cost of funding\/deposits. The company has shown significant growth in MRR, with a 3x increase in the past six weeks. Sureti has 114 active loans worth $2.7 million and an asset valuation of $7 million. Additionally, the company has 319 active deposit users, and the net dollar retention rate is 188%.\n\nUnit Economics\n--------------\n\nSureti has a strong unit economics model that drives a competitive advantage over fintechs and incumbents. The company has a LTV\/CAC of 4.0 and a cost to serve 30% lower than microloans. Sureti's coverage on real estate collateral is 2.6, and there is no bad debt. The company has high liquid assets, with $6 million in asset value. The average deposit per user is $10,000, and the risk is accepted by the user. The cost of funding is 30x faster than other fintechs and banks, and the disbursement time is 10 days.\n\nChannel Acquisition & Unit Economics\n------------------------------------\n\nSureti uses alternative channels to tackle informality, with digital paid accounting for 63% of the channel mix. The company also uses freelance consultants, on-street freelance, and referrals. Sureti has high efficiency and excellent execution of the capital raised. The company has a burn multiple of 1.46 and a hype-factor of 1.70. Deposit users are Sureti's entry point to fund the loans.\n\nThe Team and Next Steps\n-----------------------\n\nSureti's team includes Andres and his family, who have 20 years of experience in secured loans with real estate assets, and Carlos, who has designed and developed software for over 14 years. The company aims to reach $1.9 million in ARR in 18 months, with milestones that include reducing disbursement time to 5 days and improving the risk engine. Sureti also plans to expand its footprint in seven cities, offer two new credit lines, and structure debt financing."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Please read the following email and sum it up in a concise and clear way:\nHello All,\n\nI was asked to look into this topic of Balance and Center Balance matched veneer specifications. I spoke with Ben Castellon and WI and did a deep dive into the NAAWS 4.0. Unfortunately, the NAAWS manual is only slightly more illuminating than the specifications Architects often provide. I\u2019m trying to present what we know here in the shortest and clearest way possible, but I apologize if the delivery is convoluted. The material certainly is \ud83d\ude0a. Here is a brief TLDR summary:\n\nIf a project is specified as Premium Grade in regards to the veneer paneling, then Balance Matching is the default requirement. \n\nBalance matching requires us, is in the least restrictive definition of the term, to order our panels from our supplier as balanced match, and then trim both sides of a Balance Matched panel equally to achieve the final width of the panels. \nThis means the panels need to be laid out and cut on the panel saw, not the CNC = More material waste and shop labor. \n\nA \u201cSequenced\u201d Specification adds a whole new level of complexity and cost to the mix. Unfortunately, WI has four separate definitions for what can constitute \u201cSequence\u201d matching, plus more definitions for the more selective \u201cBlueprint\u201d matching specification. \n\n \n\u201cBalance Matched\u201d panels are defined as such on page 383 of the NAAWS-\n \n \nCenter Balanced is the same as balance matched, with the exception that there is a seam in the center of the panel rather than a flitch.\n \n \n \nReading these two definitions by the letter, you would assume that the outer two leaves on the panels could be any size after edge-trimming. For instance, if you had a balanced panel with 8\u201d veneer leaves, the outermost two leaves could be 2\u201d. This would suggest that we could conform to this specification by ordering panels at full width from the manufacturer, then cutting them down equally from both edges to maintain a balance match. This is potentially a huge waste of material, and a huge increase in labor time as every panel will need to be laid out and cut on the panel saw. Notably, the specification calls for Balance matching being the Default for a Premium Grade wall panel specification, meaning that the specs would have to specifically call for a running match for us to avoid balance matching the panels on a Premium Grade Job. \n \nBen Castellon recommended RFI\u2019ing a Premium Grade veneer spec or a specifically Balanced Match veneer spec during the bid phase, as the increased cost is substantial.\n \nNow, to make it really complicated, let\u2019s add sequencing into the mix:\n \nIf sequenced panels are specified and the project is Premium Grade, they must be balanced match:\nWI States at 8.6.2.1\n \n\nNow it gets trickier. WI allows for several types of Sequencing:\n Pre-Manufactured Sequenced Sets Full Width Panel Utilization\n\u2022 This specification assumes that panels will be delivered and installed at full size, 4x8, 4x10, etc. Balance matched. Edges or \u201cfiller\u201d or \u201cMakeup\u201d panels do not need to be sequenced. Since drawings almost never show full width panels with little fillers at the edges, I would say the Architect\u2019s plans often preclude our ability to sequence this way.\nPre-Manufactured Sequenced Sets Selectively Reduced Panel Utilization\n\u2022 This scenario is the tack we are taking on Menlo Park CC, where we are ordering the panels sequenced at full size, balance matched, and then trimming both edges equally to the specified panel size after field measurement, and installing in sequence.","output":"The author investigated the topic of Balance and Center Balance matched veneer specifications and found that for Premium Grade veneer paneling, Balance Matching is the default requirement, which means ordering panels from the supplier as balanced match and trimming both sides equally. \"Sequenced\" specifications add complexity and cost.

The first line includes the SoftwareSerial library, which provides the ability to create additional software-based serial ports on an Arduino.\n```c++\n#include <SoftwareSerial.h>\n```\n1. Next, a new SoftwareSerial object is created and named \"GSMSerial\". This object is used to communicate with the GSM module connected to pins 7 and 8 of the Arduino.\n```c++\nSoftwareSerial GSMSerial(7, 8);\n```\n1. In the `setup()` function, the serial communication for both the Arduino's hardware serial port and the software serial port are initialized with baud rates of 9600 and 19200 respectively. A delay of 1000 milliseconds is added to allow the GSM module to start up before sending the first SMS message.\n```c++\nvoid setup() {\n  Serial.begin(9600);\n  GSMSerial.begin(19200);\n\n  delay(1000);\n  smsSend();\n}\n```\n1. The `loop()` function repeatedly calls the `smsReceive()` function to check for incoming SMS messages.\n```c++\nvoid loop() {\n  smsReceive();\n}\n```\n1. The `smsReceive()` function checks if there is any data available to read from the GSM module. If there is, the data is read and sent to the Arduino's hardware serial port for display on a connected computer.\n```c++\nvoid smsReceive() {\n  if (GSMSerial.available()) {\n    Serial.write(GSMSerial.read());\n  }\n}\n```\n1. The `smsSend()` function sends an SMS message. It first sends the AT command to the GSM module to check its connectivity. Then, it sets the SMS message format to text mode using the AT+CMGF command.\n```c++\nvoid smsSend() {\n  Serial.println(\"Executed\");\n\n  GSMSerial.println(\"AT\");\n  delay(100);\n  GSMSerial.println(\"AT+CMGF=1\");\n  delay(200);\n```\n1. The mobile number to which the message is to be sent is entered using the AT+CMGS command. The `+` symbol indicates the country code of the mobile number. The message to be sent is then entered and terminated with the ASCII code for the CTRL+Z character (char 26).\n```c++\n  GSMSerial.print(\"AT+CMGS=\\\"\");\n  GSMSerial.print(\"+\");  \/\/ mobile number with country code\n  GSMSerial.println(\"\\\"\");\n  delay(500);\n  GSMSerial.println(\"dsaasd\");  \/\/ Type in your text message here\n  delay(500);\n  GSMSerial.println((char)26);  \/\/ This is to terminate the message\n  delay(500);\n}\n```\n1. Once the message is sent, the program waits for any incoming SMS messages by calling the `smsReceive()` function again in the `loop()` function.\n\nThat's the end of the code explanation."}

{"instruction":"","input":"First I will provide you with some of my writing, take note of the style as well of the context.\n\nPlease use this space to describe how these events have impacted you.\n\nMy family was already struggling to meet our monthly expenses. It didn't help that my dad had to close down his retail stores in the city due to the pandemic. We created two new companies that year. Due to our financial situation, my family had decided to move to Texas from New York; this would be our fifth home since I was born. We understood what this called for, but packing and unpacking are still highly time-consuming, taking away from the limited time we had.\n\nMy side business of buying and selling sought-after sneakers using automation software was also taking off at the time, so I would manage that simultaneously. I did my best to focus in class, but I admit I often worked or packed while I should've been paying attention in class.\n\nMoving came with a whole new school where I couldn't choose my classes because I was enrolled late and wasn't even able to meet with my counselor due to covid restrictions. I juggled online classes and started new businesses back up with my dad. Covid-19 entirely shifted the way we lived from our environment and stress levels to our friends, or the lack thereof.\n\n--\n\nAdditional Info\n\nMany times during the last two years, I've sacrificed my focus on education to prioritize family. I've never concentrated less on school than in 2021, my junior year and a time when I was supposed to be applying for college. \n\nMy mother was expecting my baby brother. My grandparents had just come to live with us. My elder sister was in the hospital undergoing chemotherapy as she had been diagnosed with lymphoma in March of 2021. My dad had been searching for work and found a restaurant space he would start leasing the same month of my sister's diagnosis. As the old saying goes, when it rains, it pours. \n\nMy typical day would consist of taking online classes while replying to customers of my e-commerce business and designing content or adjusting the website for my dad's restaurant. During the lunch break, I would pack orders, prepare them to ship out, and then have my actual lunch during my next class. After classes ended around 4:30, I'd go to the hospital to check up on my sister before rushing back home to get ready to work at the restaurant until eleven at night. My grandfather, who has Parkinson's and suffers from dementia, routinely forgets where he is and runs out of the house. Since my mom could not run after him, every few days, we'd have to come back early and try to find him walking through an empty street at night. \n\nObviously, this schedule left no time for studying and sometimes not even for homework. I remember staying up until 1 or 2 am after getting back to finish AP US History assignments. Since it was so impossible to retain information in class, I'd decided not to take the SAT and even skip one of three of my AP tests. I worked late nights the entire month of May, and the one day I missed work because I had an AP test in the morning was a disaster at the restaurant. \n\nSince I was little, I've been a straight A's, school-first student. Unfortunately, it became challenging to keep up with this mindset, but I'm happy that I learned through the obstacles and, as a result, became a more rigid and more well-rounded individual. \n\n--\n\nSMU Application:\nSMU appeals to students for a variety of reasons. Briefly describe why you are interested in attending SMU and what specific factors have led you to apply. (250-word limit)\\*\n\nSMU defines my intersection of interests and morals. \n \nOne aspect that stands out is that the Cox School of Business teachers have real-world experience in the industry. An opportunity to pick their brains and bounce ideas off my professors would greatly benefit me; experience stands as the best teacher. The University also puts an emphasis on diversity and pledges that \"Every Mustang Will Be Valued.\" Playing into that, the SMU Muslim Student Association has made efforts in raising charity for local refugees, something I can easily contribute to, given my background in the field. \n \nIt's also easy to start a new student organization not already present on campus. One of my first goals would be to create a blockchain club to explore the future of the Web3 movement with my peers. The Mustangs have also partnered with the NFTU program, showing the University is open to blockchain technology. A growth environment is\n\nMy sister, who attends Boston College, recommends finding a school with a college culture I'll remember. With SMU, I get the best of both worlds, a distinct, social culture while staying close to home. Recently, I met a professor at SMU at a community service event I took part in. She encouraged me to apply and check out the campus. When I visited, there was a college football game that night, and I got to see the enthusiasm in the community\u2014a sense of livelihood I have missed since moving from New York. \nSMU is a diverse learning environment shaped by the convergence of ideas and cultures. How will your unique experiences or background enhance the University, and how will you benefit from this community? (250-word limit)\\*\nI bring my passions, culture, and experiences to SMU. Sharing my journey with those around me and hearing theirs. Engaging in deep conversations about culture, religion, and ethics is nothing new to me and serves as an example to learn from. \n \nThe best way to gain wisdom is from people and the environment. Being a Pakistani who comes from a background valuing family above all, I've gotten the chance to learn from the extraordinary journeys of the many who've made the voyage to America. These are my favorite stories to hear, some came to the country with little money, and even less formal education yet were successful in their endeavors through hard work and determination. \n \nAn advantage I think about frequently is the exposure to various personalities as a teenager in the city of New York. Absorbing diverse concepts and ideals serves as a leg up on the majority that hasn't. Our backgrounds mold us into who we are. Moving five houses in less than 15 years doesn't sound ideal, but it made me who I am today, and looking back, I'm thankful for the situation it has put me in. \n \nI aim to continue discovering new personalities at SMU. There are numerous stories of people finding a founding team for their business by networking at their University. I'm hoping to accomplish the same, surrounding myself with people who can teach me concepts I'm unfamiliar with and vice-versa. Ideas build on each other, and that's how we change the world.\n--\nDMHP: Write a letter to your future self:\n\nHello Zuhair,\n\nI'm writing this letter in 2022, just a day before our 18th birthday. Just two days ago, I attended Converge22 in San Francisco with Spawn, and I'm now trying to catch up on all the work I missed while I was away. My current stresses will probably seem minor to you now, but I need to figure out how to do my Calculus homework by tomorrow, and my group for the Comets to the Core presentation didn't even start on our slides yet.\n\nIn my list of long-term goals, I have two specific ones that I'm currently working on. The first is to start working out regularly, and the second is to learn how to code. For the last two weeks, I have been waking up around 6:30 to go to the gym, and my days have been feeling a lot more productive. At Converge, many people I met recommended I pick up a coding language as a technical skill to back up my design expertise and my interest in technology. I'm trying to learn javascript, and hopefully, by the time you're reading this, I'm familiar with multiple programming languages. I think it would be a huge unlock for me to add to my knowledge and build upon, mainly because I've been experimenting with programs since a young age.\n\nYou have a lot on your hands right now, namely, doing marketing for Spawn and now the UTD Investments Club. E-commerce is also doing reasonably well, but, especially in the holiday season, I just don't have enough hours in the day to concentrate on everything at total capacity. This week I've had to be on so many zoom calls while we put in proposals for sponsorships at Spawn.\n\nAnyway, I hope all is well. Whatever you do, take care of your health and spend time with family.\n\nWishing you the best - Zuhair, 2022\nTell us about a community or group to which you belong. How have you contributed to this group, and how has it benefitted you?\n\nI owe a lot of my accomplishments to my community, without which I wouldn't merely be the person I am today. Back in New York, my family played a significant role in MANA (Memon Association of North America); this group of Memons --a minority Muslim ethnic group originating from Indian and Pakistani heritage. MANA aimed to remind community members of their South Asian roots and keep a close-knit group of familiar faces.\n\nFor my parents, when they first moved, these were the only people they interacted with outside of work. In a place like New York, it's easy to get lost in fast-paced city life and forget where you come from. Memons are known for being merchants back in South Asia, so naturally, many community members also used the gatherings to network and help each other with the business and find partners for their children. \n\nEveryone starts somewhere, and for graphic design, MANA was looking for someone to design a flyer for a sports event. My dad told me I should do it, but I had no idea where to begin. I used web-based software and would screenshot the result. Looking back now, using several different fonts and colors is not as artistic as it seemed back then, but every time I look back, I see progress. \n\nMANA got me started with graphic design, and I still use the skills I first learned today; I went from picking random website templates to making my own using Adobe Illustrator and now Figma. Just this week, I am wrapping up two freelance projects for restaurants that hired me to design their logo, menu, and promotional content, and it all started by volunteering to make a cricket event graphic. My interest in design has even brought me to web design and app design, I've started experimenting with UI, and I trust I'll make the journey just like I did with flyer design. \n\nI continue to make flyers for MANA even after moving to Dallas. I owe them everything I've achieved in the design space and even business-wise. I've met my best friends by going to the event and still talk to them over discord, we're all similar in our business-mindedness, and there's no doubt the community helped shape that.\n--\nWhether it is graphic design, business ideas, or even thinking up games to play with my cousins, I have always found ways to incorporate my concepts to improve what I'm doing. I have been writing theories in a book since I was 12 years old, including developing electric cars and blockchain technology to stop corrupt government practices. Sometimes I will take breaks just to imagine the future of our existence, our roadblocks, and our objectives for a better life. In doing so, I idealize business paths for my future that solve said problems using technology. Automation has also been a focal point for me as I am interested in problem-solving and keep an open mind to upcoming innovations.\n\nI started in graphic design in 2016, and it has taken a significant portion of my time over the years. I visualize my ideas through digital work and incorporate my business sense to market products. I've learned Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Lightroom, Final Cut Pro X, and Figma, all for this purpose. Today I have designed branding language for several successful companies and continue to use digital media to my strength. My campaigns tend to go outside of the box, resulting in higher click rates due to the creative nature of the advertisements.\n\n\nThey say, \"Curiosity killed the cat,\" but most don't know the end of the idiom: \"and satisfaction brought it back.\" Satisfaction eluding to the reward that one feels once they finally find the answer they were looking for. My curiosity works similarly, sometimes not allowing me to finish my work until I have found what I am searching for, even if it may seem irrelevant at the time. I often fight with myself for needing to know how everything works; However, the pleasure it brings once I figure it out has me outweighing the cost with the benefits. \n\nThe aspect of curiosity plays into my perfectionist persona. Everything must be top-notch, or I am left with the guilt of knowing I could have done better given a bit more time down the eternal rabbit hole. The price of curiosity does not come without its compensation, though; I believe if there is interest in a subject long enough, one will eventually become a beneficiary after investing their time and\/or knowledge into a concept. \n\nMy curiosity ranges a broad spectrum with a passion for blockchain technology, efficient marketing strategy, and human psychology, to name a few. Given a chance, I will always investigate and ask questions about a field or idea that piques my interest, and once I start, there is no end in sight. Therefore the \"satisfaction\" is produced when I reach a milestone in the long journey.\n\nSelf-motivation is a concept most struggle with, though I think this is the most effective type of motive. This determination has brought itself to light in my life in various ways. Tying into the endless curiosity point, my character does not rest until I believe I have achieved the highest quality given my resources. There is always somewhere I can improve. No matter how hard I've worked, if the next day was not better than the last, then I am still failing. \n\nWhile I know it is impossible to reach perfection, this does not stop me from trying. I have an infinite amount of problems to solve and concepts to learn with less time every day, so I know if I stop pushing boundaries, they will push me.\n\nResiliency has played a factor in my school life where an 'A' could always become an 'A+,' and my presentations would take hours because the design and transitions had to be flawless. In business, I set goals for myself at 15 years old, much higher than I expected, only to hit them in a few months. A big part of that comes from the nature of my family; we've seen ups and downs, making us immune to the worst of times and cautious at the height. My mother always says, \"compare yourself only to who you were yesterday,\" meaning if I am not improving every day, I am falling behind. \n\nAt Syosset High School: \nDuring my time at Syosset High School, I could not become an officer of a club because of grade requirements. However, I did help out in the Investment club by raising funds after school, selling pizza. In the Entrepreneurship club, by getting four of my friends to join the club where we would meet with successful business people. \n\nAt Independence High School:\nWhile my time in-person at the school has been short, I have already reached out and met with the board of the National Honors Society board and am helping them create and logo for this year's merchandise using my graphic design knowledge. I enjoy this type of work as it helps me gain experience while also helping the community.\n\nElaborate on what you would like the college admission committee to know about you regarding personal qualities, unusual talents, academic strengths, community activities, etc\n\nMy university should know my story, the building blocks to who I am today. Having moved five homes, I have gotten a diverse look into the lives of others. Due to this, I can easily empathize with the challenges people face. In addition, I problem solve quicker than most after being exposed to multiple ways of doing a task. While a nomadic life may look stressful to most, it plays an advantage in developing my social consciousness. \n\nThe exposure has allowed me to contribute to community efforts, such as creating a fundraiser to supply food and essentials to those suffering in the COVID-19 pandemic in New York. My friends and I arranged boxes and negotiated with retailers to provide cost-effective supplies to give out. We utilized Facebook to search for those who needed help most at the time\u2014sometimes driving to Brooklyn, an hour drive from Long Island, just to deliver a box of food to a woman who just lost her job due to the circumstances. \n\nThen a monumental shift when my family moved to Dallas, but it was easy for me; I knew what had to be done and how to adapt. I was a pro at this point. Moving multiple times has allowed me to grasp a comprehensive view of the world and prepared me to adjust to my environment in the future. \n\nSome talents are genetic or even innate. Marketing represents this quality for me. It just seems right to me. Ever since I was young, I have been able to sell anything. At six years old, I traded my pokemon cards and snacks for what I thought was the better share of the deal. Today I run an e-commerce business selling electronics and apparel nationwide. It's just in my genes; it seems native. \nWhat do you consider to be your most important activity\/(ies) outside of school? You may include jobs, religious activities, hobbies, and special talents. Why are these important to you? \n\nExperience came in many fields for me, mainly in the last two years of my life. In 2016 I volunteered to do graphic design and photography for a local community my family was involved in. Their goal was to involve more youth members using digital media. \n\nThe only problem was, I had no prior experience. I used web-based programs for the flyer designs, and I would use my sister's Nikon camera to shoot pictures for the photography. Later on, I'd go on to explore the depths of how I can use digital media.2 I learned photography, video editing, and some graphic design in just a couple of weeks. I was eager to learn, and designing seemed to come easily with my interest in tech. \n\nLittle did I know this volunteering changed everything for me. It took years to grasp some design and video editing concepts, many of which I don't even know today, but most beneficial was the start. A few years later, I was hired for some baking company to make Instagram posts. I would charge $20 for each. Looking back at it, I realize my prices were extremely low for the quality of work. \n\nDuring the same time, my friend had told me about the profitable business of reselling sneakers. I tried that and started using my graphic design experience to create high-ranking eBay listings for what I was selling. I didn't think much of it for some time...\n\nThen the world was hit with the COVID-19 pandemic. I started to help my dad shift his business because his sole source of income, physical cell phone stores, had to be shut down due to the state mandate. My dad and I would build a wholesale brand in March of 2020 to make an income. I would also explore resale opportunities on the side, separately, that I would start saving up and investing in. From some birthday money I was saving up for three years, I had managed to buy shoes, toys, and other limited, high-profit items. \n\nWhen we moved to Texas, I had some capital left after liquidating my small stock in New York. I made choices based on what we learned in class, and I would buy popular children's toys and games to prepare for the holiday season when supply would be low, but demand would skyrocket. The market was low on stock due to shipping difficulties regarding the pandemic, increasing the already high holiday premiums leading to my first 1,000 orders, all while attending virtual classes from my laptop. I would write my essays early in the morning to have enough time to package shipments for the afternoon. \n\n\nWhich high school teacher\/class has impacted you most, and why\/how?\n\nIn 10th grade, I took a College Marketing Class; this would be my first College Level course, earning me six credits by the end of the school year. The class would serve my interests and introduce new strategies to me. \n\nThrough the course, I gained the opportunity to be selected for a marketing and design competition\u2014a perfect blend of my skills. We were posed with creating a logo and rebranding strategy for an old Italian restaurant looking to open itself up to a younger crowd. Using my graphic design experience and my newly found marketing strategies, I worked a month on the poster board and elements to present. I would stay after school and come early to create what I thought was my best work at the time. \n\nI ended up getting 2nd place out of the 32 contestants that day. The only weakness in my display was my presenting skills; I had focused too much on the graphics and board aesthetics that I forgot to review the delivery. I'd be super observant in class for the rest of the course to up my presentation ability. I felt so defeated that I watched hours of presenters on YouTube for the next few months. I've watched TED Talks on every topic. Today, I am a confident presenter and can establish my presence acting as a magnet to watch and absorb.\n\nIn what ways are you more prepared to live independently than you were two years ago?\n\nFor most of last year, I already felt I was living independently. My sister was home from Boston College after getting diagnosed with Leukemia. My mother was expecting my younger brother. Meanwhile, my dad would search for work, and my little sister would be in school until 3:30. With my virtual classes in session, I would be responsible for making my meals and making enough for my mom and sisters. I realized afterward that the experience helped a lot with my time management skills, even experimenting by getting up earlier to give myself a head start on the day. I downloaded the Walmart+ app, so instead of going to the grocery store when my mom wasn't feeling well, we could just order groceries digitally, saving a lot of time and energy.\n\nWhat do you hope to accomplish in the future? What are your post-graduate plans?\n\nHave you ever heard of the 'Zone of Genius'? Gay Hendricks wrote about the concept in his book The Big Leap. Simply put, it is the point where all your skills and your 'innate genius' meet. The zone is what is most seems most effortless for you and difficult for the majority. To bring it to its potential, we must practice our natural talent and blend it with our passions. For me, that is Graphic Design and Marketing paired with my interest in blockchain technology. Along with some friends, I have already started building a project utilizing the technology, and I have so many ideas on how to implement it into everyone's daily life. \n\nBlockchain is my future because it is ultimately humanity's future. The technology is our only hope to introduce a transparent commerce system when the people in power prefer to hide their shady dealings. It solves the problem of corruption and resolves some of the power of giant corporations. Blockchain technology can't be stopped, and nor can I.\n\nThe only thing I know for certain is that blockchain will be involved in my future; the rest is flexible. Given the adaptable nature I eluded earlier, I am willing to go where life takes me. \n\nWhat other information would be helpful for your counselor to know? Difficulties overcome, struggles, mitigating circumstances, passions... Be sure to mention if you moved to our school during HS, if you have a disability, or if anything else has impacted your GPA. \n\nMy GPA would look better if I did not engage in multiple out-of-school activities last year. I would work on my e-commerce business for a significant portion of the day, leaving less time for school work and studying. The only day I took off was the day of my AP test. Had I portioned the time out for studying instead of working, I would see the results in my favor. However, I decided on my future as I believe the experience I gained combats a few percentage points. \n\nThe same goes for my SAT, I probably should have studied when I was working, but I did not. I took my first SAT this year with no PSAT before. Decisions were made; I can't tell if they were good ones until the future.\n\nAs for my Freshman and Sophomore grades, I am pretty satisfied knowing the rigorous courses offered there. I never missed honor roll any quarter, and knowing how competitive the school was, it felt like an outstanding achievement. The classes were challenging, and I knew no one with a perfect GPA there. \n\nHowever, I learned that Frisco School District often allows retests on every exam until a student reaches 100% and uses other tactics such as 'waterfalling' to ensure no student fails. Therefore my GPA will be lower than most of the others because my former school did not allow such practices. Although this is the case, I won't let it worry me as it will push me harder to come out on top.","output":"Based on your writing, it seems that you have had to overcome a number of challenges and obstacles in your academic career, including managing multiple businesses and caring for your family during difficult times.

{"instruction":"","input":"Why, before healthful practice, was it so common for a woman to die during childbirth? Do other species have this problem?","output":"There are many reasons why childbirth has historically been a risky and dangerous process for women, and some of these risks continue to exist today. Some of the factors that contribute to the risks of childbirth include:\n\n1. Anatomical factors: The human pelvis is relatively narrow, which can make it difficult for the baby to pass through during delivery. This can lead to complications such as obstructed labor, which can be dangerous for both the mother and the baby.\n2. Medical conditions: Some medical conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, can increase the risks of complications during childbirth.\n3. Poor access to healthcare: In many parts of the world, women may not have access to skilled healthcare providers or modern medical facilities, which can make childbirth more dangerous.\n4. Lack of knowledge and education: In some societies, women may not have access to information about how to have a safe pregnancy and childbirth.\n\nOther species do not have the same risks of childbirth as humans. For example, many other mammals have much wider pelvises, which makes childbirth easier and less risky. Additionally, some species, such as marsupials, have a very short gestation period, which reduces the risks of complications during pregnancy."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Write a blog post about frugality in the style of Mr. Money Mustache","output":"Frugality is a concept that has gained a lot of popularity in recent years, particularly with the rise of the minimalist and financial independence movements. At its core, frugality is about making the most of what you have and being mindful of your spending habits in order to achieve your financial goals.\n\nOne person who has become synonymous with frugality is Mr. Money Mustache, a personal finance blogger who rose to fame by documenting his journey to financial independence through frugal living. In this blog post, we'll take a look at some of the key principles of frugality as outlined by Mr. Money Mustache, and how you can apply them to your own life to achieve financial freedom.\n\nFirst and foremost, frugality is about prioritizing your spending. This means taking a hard look at your expenses and cutting out anything that isn't essential or that doesn't bring value to your life. This could be as simple as canceling unnecessary subscriptions or cutting back on dining out, but it could also involve making bigger changes like downsizing your home or selling a car.\n\nAnother important aspect of frugality is being proactive about finding ways to save money. This could mean shopping around for the best prices, using coupons, or taking advantage of sales and discounts. It could also mean getting creative and finding alternative ways to meet your needs, such as bartering or using free or low-cost resources like the library or community centers.\n\nBut frugality isn't just about cutting costs \u2013 it's also about making the most of what you have. This means finding ways to get more value out of your purchases by using them for as long as possible and maintaining them well. It could also mean finding ways to generate additional income, such as through a side hustle or by renting out a spare room.\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of adopting a frugal lifestyle is that it can help you achieve financial independence more quickly. By living below your means and saving and investing wisely, you can build up a nest egg that will allow you to live comfortably without the need to work for a traditional employer. This can give you the freedom to pursue your passions and live a more fulfilling life.\n\nIn conclusion, frugality is a powerful tool for achieving financial freedom and living a more fulfilling life. By prioritizing your spending, being proactive about finding ways to save money, and making the most of what you have, you can set yourself on the path to financial independence and live a life that is rich in experiences and fulfillment, not just material possessions."}

How about the Ukraine impeachment inquiry? \u2014 but criminal charges, and a subsequent arrest, could have a dramatic effect on his 2024 campaign. Never before has a former president been charged with a crime.\n\nHere are the active investigations:\n\nThe Stormy Daniels hush money investigation (Manhattan District Attorney's Office)\nThis criminal case centers on a $130,000 hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, an adult film actor, made just before the 2016 election in order to quiet her allegations of an affair with Trump.\n\nWhat Trump's 'arrest' claim says about his hold on politics and the 2024 election\nPOLITICS\nWhat Trump's 'arrest' claim says about his hold on politics and the 2024 election\nDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, says that she and Trump had an affair at a celebrity golf tournament in 2006. As Trump's campaign for president picked up steam, she offered to sell her story to gossip magazines. In October, executives at the National Enquirer, a publication long friendly to Trump, alerted Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.\n\nCohen reached an agreement with Daniels to pay her $130,000 in exchange for keeping her story quiet. Her attorney received the money from Cohen on Oct. 27, less than two weeks before the election.\n\nAfter Trump was elected president, Cohen was reimbursed with a total of $420,000, to account for taxes and other costs. Some of the reimbursement checks were signed by Trump himself, who has admitted to repaying Cohen for money paid to Daniels. He has denied having the affair.\n\nManhattan DA presenting evidence in Trump-Stormy Daniels investigation to grand jury\nLAW\nManhattan DA presenting evidence in Trump-Stormy Daniels investigation to grand jury\nAccording to court records, the Trump Organization's top executives falsely identified the reimbursements as a \"retainer\" for \"legal services.\"\n\nNow, the grand jury is examining whether Trump committed a felony under New York state law by falsifying business records to cover up another crime \u2014 like the violation of campaign finance laws with the hush money payment.\n\nThe case is being brought by Alvin Bragg Jr., who was elected district attorney of New York County in 2021. He took over the case from his predecessor, Cyrus Vance Jr., who had opened a broad criminal inquiry into Trump's business activities while Trump was still president.\n\nMeet the Manhattan DA who would bring criminal charges against Trump\nMAIN CHARACTER OF THE DAY\nMeet the Manhattan DA who would bring criminal charges against Trump\nEarlier this month, reports emerged that prosecutors in the Manhattan district attorney's office had offered Trump the chance to testify before a grand jury. In New York, that's usually a signal that charges are coming soon, as potential defendants must have the opportunity to answer questions in the grand jury before an indictment. (Trump declined the offer to testify.)\n\nThe Georgia 2020 election interference investigation (Fulton County District Attorney's Office)\nThe Georgia case centers on the actions of Trump and his allies in the weeks following the 2020 presidential election, as they pressured state officials to undo his loss in the state.\n\nAfter Trump narrowly lost the state, he repeatedly called Georgia state officials to pressure them to find ways to change the outcome \u2014 including the infamous call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Jan. 2, 2021, in which he instructed the Republican Raffensperger to \"find 11,780 votes.\" Trump also called Gov. Brian Kemp and the state attorney general to urge them to contest the election results.\n\nIn his new book, Georgia's top voting official goes deep on infamous call with Trump\nTHE NPR POLITICS PODCAST\nIn his new book, Georgia's top voting official goes deep on infamous call with Trump\nThe inquiry has also examined efforts to send slates of fake electors to the Electoral College to say that Trump won, rather than Joe Biden.\n\nThe investigation is led by Fani Willis, the top prosecutor in Fulton County, Ga., where a special grand jury spent eight months hearing from more than 70 witnesses. Their work was finalized in early January. A portion of their report was released last month, but a judge ruled that most of it should remain confidential, for now.\n\nWillis has said decisions on indictments are \"imminent.\" It's not clear if Trump would be among those charged. Possible crimes for him or others could include soliciting election fraud, giving false statements to government bodies and racketeering.\n\nA pair of investigations into Trump's actions around Jan. 6 and his mishandling of classified documents (the U.S. Department of Justice)\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has two ongoing investigations into possible criminal actions by Trump. Both probes are being led by Special Counsel Jack Smith, who was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland last year.\n\nWho is DOJ Special Counsel Jack Smith? \nINVESTIGATIONS\nWho is DOJ Special Counsel Jack Smith?\nOne of the investigations centers on how Trump handled classified documents after his presidency ended. Last June, a lawyer for Trump certified that a \"diligent search\" for classified documents had been conducted at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and all documents found had been turned over to federal authorities. But two months later, an FBI raid recovered more than 100 additional documents.\n\n(President Biden has been embroiled in his own classified documents scandal after files were found to be improperly stored at his Delaware home and a think tank office in Washington he previously used. A different special counsel has also been appointed to investigate that.)\n\nSmith is also looking at Trump's attempt to interfere with the 2020 election. As part of that probe, prosecutors have interviewed numerous Trump allies and aides. They've also subpoenaed former Vice President Mike Pence, whom Trump pressured intensely to overturn the election results during the certification process on Jan. 6.\n\nThe Pence subpoena could set up a showdown over executive privilege\n\nThe Pence subpoena could set up a showdown over executive privilege\nProsecutors are also reportedly investigating the finances of Save America, a Trump-affiliated political action committee.\n\nThe DOJ investigations are ongoing.

These patterns are widely used in software development to solve common problems and improve the quality of code.\n\nThe 23 patterns are divided into three categories:\n\n1. Creational Patterns: These patterns provide mechanisms for object creation that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code. The five creational patterns are:\n* Abstract Factory\n* Builder\n* Factory Method\n* Prototype\n* Singleton\n1. Structural Patterns: These patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures, while keeping them flexible and easy to modify. The seven structural patterns are:\n* Adapter\n* Bridge\n* Composite\n* Decorator\n* Facade\n* Flyweight\n* Proxy\n1. Behavioral Patterns: These patterns define the interactions between objects and how they communicate with one another, while also providing solutions to common communication issues. The eleven behavioral patterns are:\n* Chain of Responsibility\n* Command\n* Interpreter\n* Iterator\n* Mediator\n* Memento\n* Observer\n* State\n* Strategy\n* Template Method\n* Visitor\n\nBy using the GoF design patterns, developers can create software that is more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain, which ultimately leads to better software design and faster development."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Can you explain to me what prototype and delegate means in Swift? Use some example that can be understood by a high school student3","output":"Sure, I can explain what prototype and delegate mean in Swift!\n\nIn Swift, a prototype is an initial version of an object or a function that can be used as a template to create new instances with similar properties and behavior. Essentially, it's a blueprint that defines the characteristics of an object or a function, such as its attributes and methods, but does not actually create the object or execute the function.\n\nFor example, let's say you wanted to create a simple game in which the player can move a character around on the screen. You might start by creating a prototype of the character that defines its properties and behaviors, such as its size, color, and movement functions. Then, you could use this prototype to create multiple instances of the character throughout the game, each with their own unique characteristics.\n\nIn Swift, a delegate is an object that is assigned to handle certain events or actions for another object. When an event or action occurs, the object that it belongs to will call a method on its delegate to handle it. Delegates are commonly used in iOS app development to handle user interactions with the app, such as tapping a button or selecting an item from a list.\n\nFor example, let's say you were building a simple weather app that displayed the current temperature and weather conditions for a given location. You might create a delegate object to handle the user's selection of a location from a list of available options. When the user selects a location, the app would call a method on the delegate object to update the display with the new temperature and weather information for that location.\n\nI hope that helps explain what prototype and delegate mean in Swift! Let me know if you have any more questions."}

start your own location dependent high margin high income low work alpha 2.0 business in this video i will give you another video i pulled from one of my online courses that is very expensive that i'm about to give to you for free on how to determine your own niche how to niche your business so that you have an easier time finding customers and clients and they pay you much more money because your niche this\n(00:32) is a key key point in the process so watch this very carefully take notes if you need to because this is one of those make or break things and this is something most business owners don't do they don't bother in a niche they just want to sell something to everybody and they wonder why they don't make it work so once again here is myself and my lovely assistant julia taking away myself okay we're going to talk about something that is core to your business success core to your financial success in life\n(01:01) in terms of business and something that sadly is the most difficult aspect of starting an alpha 2.0 business it's something that is not very fun but it's something you got to do and once you get through it this is the good news once you get through doing this everything else is easy and everything else is fun this is the hardest part it's also the most important part and that is determining your niche now here's what i mean by niche this is an example i've used before who makes more money a business attorney\n(01:32) or a business attorney who focuses on mergers and acquisitions that's all he does i will tell you for a fact this guy makes more money has larger paying customers has new gets new customers more quickly and easily okay has less competition can charge more money and has less customer turnover this guy makes way more money and works less hours than this guy because he's specialized he's chosen a niche now that's a specialization mergers and acquisitions here's a niche let's take this guy and move them over\n(02:08) here so who makes more money the guy who is an attorney with mergers and acquisitions or mergers and acquisitions attorney who only works in the grocery store industry he only works with grocery stores and no one else again this guy makes far more money and works less hours and charges more money and has more customers and more customers easily and easier marketing than this guy because he's niched this guy did not say oh no i can't make as much money as this guy because i'm narrowing my market my market will be\n(02:39) too small there isn't enough grocery stores in the entire planet for me to make a good six-figure income he didn't say that he said cool i'm in a niche because i want to make a lot of money you must niche your business you must do it it is a requirement you cannot just be a fitness guy i get these guys all the time i'm a fitness guy i've lost a bunch of weight and i want to start a website on how to lose weight you'll get killed you'll get murdered and i would no i need to lose weight i'm working on it\n(03:08) you will get absolutely killed because how many other websites are there for how to how to lose weight when you're a guy or even how to lose weight as a woman there's a billion of them now if instead you said and this is just an example i'm not saying do this okay this off top my head you said i am going to start a fitness business for divorced asian men over 50.\n(03:30) sounds funny but that's a niche you're going to make money if you go into business with i'm a fitness guy i'm going to show you how to get buff you're going to go out of business so fast you'll make your head spin you're going to waste so much time and so much money and you're going to say ah business doesn't work i'll get a job you must niche never think for a minute that your niche is too narrow it won't be the more narrow the niche the better they call it micro niching\n(03:53) sometimes you can niche inside a niche okay i didn't just say asian men i said asian men over 40 who were divorced or asian men were 50 or whatever i'm narrowing down the niche i don't sell black dragon material to men i don't sell it to men and i've actually made that very clear on my blog i saw it to a very particular type of guy right i talked about that last time unmarried men aged 25 to 45 who don't need monogamy that's a niche um i'll give you several examples so when i was first starting the black\n(04:20) dragon business there were a lot of guys and this is back in 2009-ish or so there are a lot of guys who are writing you know how to get laid how to get laid books okay i didn't write a how to get laid book i didn't want to because that's not a niche i'm a businessman i don't want to just go into competition against the entire world i want a niche and i want to master that niche and own that niche so i wrote about back in 2009 online dating which back then was an itch today it's not a niche today\n(04:45) everyone does it so if you wrote a book now an online dating you'll be going whatever but back then that was a niche i also wrote about what was the other niche i wrote about if you guys know a lot of you do know non-monogamous relationships dating multiple women at the same time and not lying to any of them having open relationships open marriages things like that that was a niche who else was talking about that who else talks about that now not really not really so that's a niche third niche i had and this is a niche that i\n(05:08) discovered through my audience over time the audience told me they wanted this was older men dating much younger women a lot of guys get divorced divorce rates going up as you know if you've read my blogs so you have a lot of older guys who are now divorced they want to date someone younger they've never done it they don't know how to do it they've been married 15 years and have no dating skills in that area so they have to learn so my three niches in the black dragon business at least historically\n(05:29) it's changing a little bit now but historically we're online dating which back then was a niche non-monogamous relationships and older men dating younger women i did not write a book on how to get laid now i do have a book on real life dating called get to sex fast but that's only within the niche makes sense so all my businesses are niched okay i talked about that earlier i have a marketing company i don't market to anybody i don't say here i'll show any company how to market no no it's not even an it marketing\n(05:56) company but sometimes i say it marketing it's not even i t that's not small enough of a niche i have a niche on-site computer consulting so when we actually prospect for new clients for that business we have to call them say do you offer on-site computer consulting services sometimes they say no no we're programmers or we're web guys or we're we sell servers don't want those guys i'm only niche for guys who do on-site consulting that's my niche and because of that i am instantly perceived\n(06:26) correctly as an expert because i'm in that niche i can also charge a lot more money i can also track business much more easily because i know everything about that niche so when you're highly niched the people in your niche will see you and choose you over every other option and you can have higher prices because you're niched and your customers won't leave as often and you won't need as many customers because you'll charge higher prices there are so many benefits to having a niche that it's something\n(06:52) you can't skip you can't do it you will be tempted to not do this you will be tempted to not have a niche you will be tempted to do whatever it is you want to do and you probably already have an idea in your head to just do that and sell to everybody no you have to niche as much as humanly possible and then you figure out your offering so that's the other key point here you have your niche which is your market and you have your offering your offering is what you are selling product service or information or some combination\n(07:20) thereof okay you determine your niche first then you determine your offering 95 of people who start a business do this the other way around they say i'm good at computers so i'm going to sell computers or i'm a fitness guy so i'm going to sell fitness services or what i'm an artist so i'm going to sell how to draw or how to paint no you start with your niche first and you identify a niche you identify a problem that niche has or a strong need that niche has and we'll talk about exactly\n(07:52) how to do that soon then when you've determined the niche and the need of that niche then you determine your offering then you determine okay how do i help this niche solve this problem or fulfill this need now your odds of making money in your business go from very low you've read the statistics about how often businesses go out they fail within the first two years 80 90 70 depending on the studies you read the reason people do that is because they don't niche they don't go through this process they say\n(08:20) i'm good at this i'm going to sell this no if you turn that around determine the niche first determine the problem determine the need then determine your offering that it directly addresses that need your odds of success have just gone way up and when you start making money and you probably will you will make a lot more money much more easily and much more quickly because you've done this you're selling something directly to a niche to help that niche you're not just pulling something out of your brain\n(08:45) because you think it's exciting okay now that doesn't mean you have to do something you hate you can also match that offering to your own needs abilities

{"instruction":"","input":"Explain quantum computing in simple terms","output":"Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum bits or qubits instead of the classical bits used in traditional computing. A classical bit can only be in one of two states, either 0 or 1, but a qubit can be in multiple states at the same time, which is known as superposition.\n\nThis allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers, as they can process multiple possibilities simultaneously. Additionally, qubits can become entangled, meaning that the state of one qubit affects the state of the other, even if they are far apart.\n\nQuantum computing is still in its early stages and is currently being explored for its potential applications in fields like cryptography, optimization, and materials science."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Your role is a game development expert and I want to know how to build a Battle Royale style video game using Unreal Engine 5","output":"Sure, I can help you with that! Building a Battle Royale style game using Unreal Engine 5 involves several steps, including designing the game mechanics, creating assets, setting up the environment, implementing the gameplay, and testing.\n\nHere's an overview of the process:\n\n1. Design the game mechanics: Battle Royale games typically involve a large number of players dropped onto an island, where they must gather weapons, resources, and other items, while fighting each other until only one player or team remains. You'll need to decide on the specifics of your game mechanics, such as the size of the map, the number of players, the type of weapons, and the objectives.\n2. Create assets: To create a Battle Royale game, you'll need to create a lot of assets, including characters, weapons, items, buildings, and terrain. You can either create your own assets or purchase them from a marketplace, such as the Unreal Engine Marketplace or other third-party vendors.\n3. Set up the environment: You'll need to create a large, detailed environment for your Battle Royale game. This involves creating the terrain, vegetation, buildings, and other environmental objects.\n4. Implement gameplay: Once you have your assets and environment set up, you'll need to implement the gameplay mechanics. This involves programming the AI, creating the user interface, and setting up the game logic.\n5. Test the game: Finally, you'll need to thoroughly test your game to make sure it's working properly. This includes testing the AI, the multiplayer functionality, and the user interface.\n\nHere are some specific tips for using Unreal Engine 5 to build a Battle Royale game:\n\n1. Use the new Nanite technology: Unreal Engine 5 introduced a new technology called Nanite, which allows for real-time rendering of incredibly detailed scenes. This technology is ideal for large, detailed environments like those found in Battle Royale games.\n2. Use the Chaos physics engine: Unreal Engine 5 also includes the Chaos physics engine, which allows for realistic physics simulations. This is important for a Battle Royale game, where physics can play a big role in the gameplay.\n3. Use the built-in multiplayer features: Unreal Engine 5 includes built-in multiplayer functionality, which makes it easy to create a multiplayer Battle Royale game. You can use the engine's built-in matchmaking and networking features to create a seamless multiplayer experience.\n4. Use third-party plugins and assets: The Unreal Engine Marketplace and other third-party vendors offer a wide range of plugins and assets that can help you speed up your development process. Be sure to check out these resources to see if there's anything that can help you build your game more quickly and efficiently.\n\nI hope these tips help you get started on building your Battle Royale game using Unreal Engine 5!"}

It then loops through each connection and checks if the local endpoint (IP address and port) is open and not in use.\n\nThe `if` statement checks if the port is greater than 1023 (reserved ports) and if the IP address is not the loopback address (127.0.0.1).\n\nNote that this code only checks for open and not in use ports on the local system. If you need to check for open ports on a remote system, you will need to use a different approach."}

{"instruction":"","input":"How do I make an HTTP request in Javascript?","output":"There are several ways to make an HTTP request in JavaScript. Here are a few options:\n\n1. Using the `XMLHttpRequest` object: This is a built-in object in JavaScript that allows you to make HTTP requests. You can use the `open` method to specify the request method (e.g. `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc.), the URL, and whether the request should be asynchronous or not. You can then use the `send` method to send the request. Here is an example of how to make a `GET` request using the `XMLHttpRequest` object:\n```\nvar xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\nxhr.open('GET', 'http:\/\/www.example.com\/api\/data', true);\nxhr.send();\n```\n1. Using the `fetch` function: The `fetch` function is a modern alternative to the `XMLHttpRequest` object. It is a promise-based function that makes it easier to work with asynchronous requests. To make a `GET` request using the `fetch` function, you can do the following:\n```\nfetch('http:\/\/www.example.com\/api\/data')\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(data => console.log(data));\n```\n1. Using a library or framework: There are also several libraries and frameworks that provide a higher-level interface for making HTTP requests in JavaScript. Some popular options include Axios, jQuery, and Angular HTTP. These libraries can make it easier to handle things like error handling, parsing responses, and setting headers.\n\nFor example, here is how you could make a `GET` request using Axios:\n```\naxios.get('http:\/\/www.example.com\/api\/data')\n  .then(response => console.log(response.data));\n```"}

This makes it easier to handle errors uniformly across different parts of the code.\n\nThe `connected` ReactiveVar helps manage the connection state more effectively, and the autorun function that uses it ensures that connection retries are attempted reactively when the connection state changes.\n\nThese improvements should help make the code more robust and resilient to various types of failures."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Why does HTTPS\/SSL need a certificate to do secure transmission, while SSH does not?","output":"HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a protocol used to secure communication over the internet. It is used to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted between a client and a server, such as a web browser and a web server. One way it does this is by using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt the data being transmitted.\n\nSSL and TLS use a certificate to establish a secure connection. The certificate contains information about the identity of the server and is used to verify that the server is who it claims to be. This helps protect against man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker intercepts and modifies the data being transmitted between the client and the server.\n\nOn the other hand, SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol used to securely connect to a remote computer and execute commands on that computer. It is commonly used to remotely access servers for tasks such as managing systems, transferring files, and running commands.\n\nUnlike HTTPS, SSH does not use a certificate to establish a secure connection. Instead, it uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the client and the server. When a client connects to a server using SSH, the server presents the client with its public key. The client verifies the public key using a known host key, and if the key is valid, the client uses it to encrypt a message that is sent back to the server. The server can then decrypt the message using its private key, which confirms that the client has access to the correct public key and is therefore authorized to connect.\n\nIn summary, HTTPS and SSL\/TLS use a certificate to establish a secure connection and verify the identity of the server, while SSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the client and the server and establish a secure connection."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Please help me figure out how to organize my notes in Evernote. I am a therapist attending a 3-year post-grad ISTDP training. Which type of notes should I consider taking? And how would I divide them into folders and stacks?","output":"Evernote is a powerful tool for organizing notes, and there are several ways you can use it to keep track of your ISTDP training. One approach would be to create a separate notebook for each year of the training, and within each notebook, create separate notes for each class or session.\n\nYou can use tags to organize notes within each notebook. For example, you could tag notes related to specific topics or techniques, or use tags to mark notes that need further review.\n\nAnother approach would be to create a notebook for each topic or technique that you're studying, and within each notebook, create separate notes for each class or session. You can also use tags to organize notes within each notebook, such as by session or instructor.\n\nYou can also use Stacks to group related notebooks together. For example, you could create a stack for each year of the training, or for each topic or technique that you're studying.\n\nUltimately, the way you organize your notes will depend on your personal preferences and how you work best. It may be helpful to experiment with different methods and see what works best for you."}

Assume we have an ideal sampling function (Dirac Comb) with frequency twice that of the band-limited signal. We know our signal is band-limited because we filtered it with an ideal brick-wall filter with a pass-band equal to the band-width of the signal; thus the signal is strictly band-limited. So then what can we say about the spectrum of the sampled signal from a pure mathematical point of view? I'm not interested in practical or real scenarios.","output":"Given a band-limited signal x(t) with its Fourier transform X(f), we know that X(f) = 0 for |f| > f\\_max, where f\\_max is the maximum frequency of the signal. According to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, we must sample the signal at a rate of at least twice the maximum frequency, i.e., f\\_s > 2 \\* f\\_max.\n\nLet's assume we have an ideal sampling function (Dirac Comb), denoted as s(t). It consists of a series of impulses spaced by T\\_s = 1\/f\\_s in the time domain, where f\\_s is the sampling frequency.\n\ns(t) = \u2211\\_{n = -\u221e}^{\u221e} \u03b4(t - nT\\_s)\n\nNow, we sample the band-limited signal x(t) using the sampling function s(t) to obtain the sampled signal y(t):\n\ny(t) = x(t) \\* s(t)\n\nwhere \\* denotes convolution. To analyze the spectrum of the sampled signal, we need to compute the Fourier transform Y(f) of y(t):\n\nY(f) = F{y(t)} = F{x(t) \\* s(t)} = X(f) \u00d7 S(f)\n\nwhere F denotes the Fourier transform and \u00d7 denotes multiplication. The Fourier transform of the Dirac Comb s(t) is another Dirac Comb with impulses spaced by f\\_s in the frequency domain:\n\nS(f) = \u2211\\_{k = -\u221e}^{\u221e} \u03b4(f - kf\\_s)\n\nNow, we can express the Fourier transform of the sampled signal Y(f) as:\n\nY(f) = X(f) \u00d7 \u2211\\_{k = -\u221e}^{\u221e} \u03b4(f - kf\\_s)\n\nTo compute Y(f), we need to evaluate the product of X(f) and each impulse in the Dirac Comb S(f):\n\nY(f) = \u2211\\_{k = -\u221e}^{\u221e} X(f) \u00d7 \u03b4(f - kf\\_s)\n\nAs X(f) is zero outside the range [-f\\_max, f\\_max], the only nonzero contributions come from the impulses in S(f) that fall within this range:\n\nY(f) = \u2211\\_{k = -\u221e}^{\u221e} X(kf\\_s - f) \u00d7 \u03b4(f - kf\\_s)\n\nUsing the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, we can rewrite this as:\n\nY(f) = \u2211\\_{k = -\u221e}^{\u221e} X(f - kf\\_s)\n\nNow we have the spectrum of the sampled signal y(t).

{"instruction":"","input":"When one of the pairs of particles produced near a black hole falls into the event horizon, and the other escapes, explain the process step by step!copycopycopy","output":"When a pair of particles is produced near a black hole, it is typically through a process called \"vacuum polarization\" in which the strong gravitational field near the black hole creates a virtual particle-antiparticle pair that briefly exists before annihilating each other. Sometimes, due to the strong gravity of the black hole, one of the particles is pulled towards the event horizon while the other particle escapes. The process can be described step-by-step as follows:\n\n1. Vacuum polarization: The strong gravitational field of the black hole creates a virtual particle-antiparticle pair that briefly exists.\n2. Separation: Due to the strong gravity, one of the particles is pulled towards the event horizon while the other particle escapes.\n3. Time dilation: As the escaping particle moves away from the black hole, it experiences time dilation due to the strong gravitational field. This means that time appears to pass more slowly for the escaping particle relative to an observer far away from the black hole.\n4. Redshift: As the escaping particle moves away from the black hole, its energy and frequency appear to decrease due to the gravitational redshift effect. This means that the escaping particle appears to be \"cooled\" as it moves away from the black hole.\n5. Detection: The escaping particle may be detected by an observer far away from the black hole, either directly or indirectly through its effects on other matter in the vicinity.\n6. Event horizon crossing: The particle that fell towards the event horizon is effectively lost from the observable universe. Once it crosses the event horizon, it can no longer send any information or signals to observers outside the black hole, and its fate is ultimately to be consumed by the black hole's singularity.\n\nOverall, the process of one particle falling into the event horizon while the other escapes is a consequence of the strong gravity of the black hole and the effects it has on the behavior of particles and light in its vicinity."}
{"instruction":"","input":"write me a story about The Dead Frogman of Cardiff Docks\nQueen Alexandra Dock 1974\nShipping in the Queen Alexandra Dock 1974\nOne of the most significant criminal enquiries undertaken at Cardiff Docks was a case involving large quantities of drugs brought from the West Indies. It was a lengthy investigation that began with the death of a scuba diver whose body was recovered from the Queen Alexandra Dock.\n\nDuring March 1982, several anonymous telephone calls were received about a man alleged to have gone missing while using sub-aqua diving gear at the docks. Calls were made both to the South Wales Police and to the British Transport Police at the docks, initially by a female and later by a male. With each call, more details emerged- the man was described as West Indian and the location was given as the Queen Alexandra Dock.\n\nSearches by Police Underwater Search Teams did not find anything. Visibility in the dock was extremely poor and as they worked, huge conga eels slithered and scraped past the divers- it was not a pleasant experience in the inky blackness. When HMS Cardiff put into docks on a courtesy visit the opportunity was taken for a sonar sweep to be carried out. Once again nothing was found- what happens to a human body submerged in water depends on many things and the chances of finding one were minimal.\n\nHowever, some weeks after the calls began, two tugs were assisting a ship leaving the Queen Alexandra Dock and as they took up the tow their powerful screws churned up the water and a body was flushed to the surface. It was a body dressed in sub-aqua diving gear and was showing signs of having been in the water some time. At the mortuary, with the diving gear removed, it was found to be that of a West Indian male and all the circumstances suggested that this was the missing man. The heavy diving gear may also have been why the body had not surfaced earlier. A conference between senior officers of the South Wales and British Transport Police did not find agreement on whether the death should be regarded as suspicious.\n\nThe post mortem examination was carried out by eminent pathologist Professor Sir Bernard Knight, who found it difficult to establish the cause of death. But significantly, none of the tiny microbes known as diotodes, normally present in water, were found in the bone marrow possibly indicating the deceased did not die from drowning. There were also several interesting marks on the body, the significance of which would become apparent later. A square bruise was seen on the right side of the face and a similar one on the chest. There was also an unusual wide mark on the left wrist. One other piece of vital evidence came from examination of the diving equipment; the valve on the oxygen cylinder was closed, pointing to the fact that diving had been completed by the time the death occurred.\n\nDI Vic Miller began an investigation and looked for a connection with the West Indies. The shipping line Geest operated between South Wales and the West Indies and one of their boats- the MV Geestland had been diverted into Cardiff Docks a few weeks earlier, about the time the diver had gone missing. Crucially, it had unloaded its cargo of bananas on the north side of the Queens Dock, exactly where the body had been brought to the surface by the tug! The Geestland was brought back into Cardiff and dry docked and something very significant was quickly found. A length of chain was discovered hanging below the hull near the propeller. It was about 20 feet long and on the end was a shackle secured with a nut and bolt. That answered a question that had been puzzling the officers ever since the body had been found; an unexplained spanner had been discovered tied to the wet suit chest. When the spanner was matched to the shackle, they were an exact fit. And one of the Geestland\u2019s engineers told of hearing a strange metallic sound coming from the hull during the voyage from the West Indies. A picture was emerging and the police suspected that a container had been secured to the ship\u2019s hull before the vessel left the West Indies and was to be recovered when the ship arrived in the UK. The dead diver was apparently part of a well-organised drug running syndicate!\n\nFollowing a different line of enquiry, the man who had made the anonymous calls was traced and he identified the deceased as his friend- Peter Macdonald Jones. The dead man\u2019s mother told police that he had had a girlfriend known as \u2018The Duchess\u2019 who worked at a department store in Reading. At the store, a former employee was tracked to South Wales and enquiries at a store in Cardiff found that a new member of staff had recently been distressed; she had confided to a colleague that her boyfriend had died. Back in Reading, enquiries established that there were connections to some fairly undesirable people involved in the local drug scene.\n\nThe woman, known as \u2018The Duchess\u2019, was arrested and immediately lied about her identity. Realising she may have made a mistake she fell silent and remained that way throughout an initial interview. She was taken home for a search of her flat in Newport. At first, nothing incriminating was found nor was there anything to link her to Peter Jones or even to Reading. Seemingly, she was a woman without a past but as the search progressed, officers noticed that the only indication of any wealth in the flat were two original paintings by L.S. Lowery on the lounge wall. DI Miller examined the paintings and took the back off them. Between the canvas and the backboard of one was a photograph of Peter Jones and in the second was a photograph of her and Peter together. Here was the connection the police had been searching for.\n\nWith her boyfriend dead, The Duchess could see that she had nowhere else to go and her best option now was to help the police. Over time, DI Vic Miller established a rapport and her story was slowly unravelled; it proved to be a revealing story indeed. She had been set up in the flat by her boyfriend, Peter Jones, and his associate, James Timothy for the purpose of providing \u2018a safe house\u2019 for drug importation operations in South Wales. Jones was a married man and lived in Reading as did Timothy, who was believed to be heavily involved in the drugs underworld. Almost every month she would meet the two men and a canister of drugs would be recovered from a ship bringing bananas from the West Indies. She would fetch the drugs from the docks and drive them to an address in Reading, having been given a cover story in case she was stopped. The operation had been going on for nearly five years, and each consignment meant anything up to \u00a3500,000 in street value. It was understood that no-one involved in the drug trafficking should display any outward sign of wealth. Recently though, Peter Jones had begun to deviate from the rules and shortly before he died he had put down a \u00a35,000 deposit on a Porsche motor car. He had also purchased a plot of land in a residential area in Barbados and was having a bungalow built. It was not a wise move; Timothy had learned of the deposit on the car from an associate in Reading\n\nBoth Timothy and Jones were experienced divers and on that March night in 1982 they set out on one more drug recovery operation from beneath a ship. They were probably expecting the Geestland to be at Barry Docks but bad weather made Cardiff a preferred option. It was a foul night when The Duchess drove Peter Jones and James Timothy to Cardiff Docks- a gale was blowing and it was lashing with rain- in many respects perfect conditions to undertake their hazardous activity, safe from casual observation. The men changed into their diving gear and as usual it was arranged they would be dropped off by The Duchess who would return later to avoid having the car attract attention. Through the rain and the darkness, she watched them descend the steps into the uninviting water and then left; she would not see Peter Jones again.\n\nThe Duchess returned at the prearranged time but Timothy came back to the car alone. He had his diving kit but there was no sign of any drugs and he was vague and evasive about what had happened to Peter Jones. As they waited for around half an hour The Duchess became angry and began to panic, believing that Timothy had done something to him. Eventually, she drove Timothy to Newport, intending to go back and look for Jones in daylight. Timothy led her to believe that an argument had taken place about the drugs and that he had ended up hitting Jones with a lead diving belt and he had fallen back into the water. Timothy had returned to the car believing that Jones would get out alright, but obviously he had not. The Duchess made enquiries herself amongst other drug dealers to see if Jones had been heard of but she did not go as far as reporting her missing man to the police.\n\nWith the discovery of the body the investigation had intensified. One aspect concentrated on the enquiry to trace and interview Timothy, whilst others took on many of the other lines of enquiry including the Reading connection. Many long hours were spent as enquiries spread the length and breadth of the land. Officers learnt that both Peter Jones and James Timothy had contacts in the West Indies and had recently visited the islands. There was evidence that Timothy and Jones had been associates for ten years at least and both had bought diving equipment from the same shop in Falmouth five years previously.\n\nBy the middle of June, Timothy had been arrested, taken to Cardiff and interviewed at the BTP Divisional HQ. But throughout the interview he made no reply except to indicate he did not wish to answer questions. His reply was always the same and he never once lost his cool or became perturbed- he simply remained silent. Despite the serious allegations, Timothy was allowed bail and was interviewed on a further five or six occasions. The only variation from his veil of silence was an occasional stock answer- \u201cI have never murdered anyone in my life. I have the highest regard for human life.\u201d\n\nThe truth about the events that took place in the dark on the quayside at the Queen Alexandra Dock between Jones and Timothy has never been established. The police investigation had always been led with a murder or manslaughter charge in mind but although there was plenty of circumstantial evidence it was insufficient to bring a charge of homicide. No drugs were ever recovered by the police as a result of this incident, nor were any seen by The Duchess when she collected Timothy. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that there were no drugs there to be recovered. Had Jones or someone else intercepted the haul when the vessel was at an American port during its voyage? And if this was not the first consignment to go missing, was someone doing a bit of freelance work, in the USA perhaps? It may be significant that Jones\u2019 passport showed that he had recently returned to the UK from Barbados via Florida.\n\nJames Timothy was charged with conspiring with Peter Macdonald Jones and others to import controlled drugs at Cardiff Docks. He pleaded not guilty at Cardiff Crown Court but was convicted and sentenced to 7 years imprisonment. No person was ever charged in connection with the death of Peter Macdonald Jones, the dead frogman of Cardiff Docks.","output":"The investigation into the death of the West Indian diver, known as the \"Dead Frogman of Cardiff Docks,\" was a complex and lengthy one. Anonymous calls were made to the police about a missing diver, and searches were conducted in the Queen Alexandra Dock, but nothing was found. It wasn't until several weeks later, when a body surfaced during a ship's departure from the dock, that the missing diver was identified.\n\nThe post-mortem examination revealed that the cause of death was difficult to determine and that the body had several unusual marks, including a square bruise on the face and chest and a wide mark on the wrist. The diving equipment was also found to have an closed valve on the oxygen cylinder, indicating that the diver had completed his dive before his death.\n\nDI Vic Miller led the investigation and began looking for connections to the West Indies. The shipping line Geest operated between South Wales and the West Indies, and one of their boats, the MV Geestland, had been diverted to Cardiff Docks around the time of the diver's disappearance. When the ship was inspected, a length of chain was found hanging from the hull near the propeller. The police believed that a container had been secured to the ship's hull before it left the West Indies, and that the diver may have accidentally been trapped in it.\n\nThe investigation was ongoing, with many questions still unanswered, but the discovery of the chain and spanner provided crucial evidence in the case of the Dead Frogman of Cardiff Docks. The case was a tragic reminder of the dangers and mysterious of the sea and the importance of thorough investigations to uncover the truth."}

If there are not enough participants providing liquidity on a DEX, it can lead to a lack of available assets to trade and difficulty executing trades.\n* Lack of regulatory compliance: DEXs are often decentralized and operate outside of traditional financial regulatory frameworks. This can make it difficult for DEXs to comply with regulations, and can expose users to potential legal risks.\n* Security vulnerabilities: DEXs, like any other smart contract, are subject to security vulnerabilities such as the ones listed in my previous answer.\n* Frontrunning: Because DEXs operate on a public blockchain, transactions are visible to all participants on the network. This can potentially allow malicious actors to observe and frontrun trades, executing their own trades ahead of others to gain an unfair advantage.\n* Poor user experience: DEXs often have a steeper learning curve and less user-friendly interfaces compared to centralized exchanges.

Therefore, we can divide both sides of the above equation by d^2 to get:\n(a\/d) \\* (a\/d + 3) = 1\n\nLet x = a\/d, then the above equation becomes:\nx^2 + 3x - 1 = 0\n\nSolving for x using the quadratic formula, we get:\nx = (-3 \u00b1 sqrt(13))\/2\n\nSince a, b, and c are distinct integers, we know that x is not an integer. Therefore, we must have x = (-3 + sqrt(13))\/2.\n\nNow, we can easily find a, b, and c as follows:\na = xd = (-3 + sqrt(13))\/2 \\* d\nb = a + d\nc = a + 2d\n\nFinally, we can simplify the ratios a:b:c as follows:\na:b = (-3 + sqrt(13)):2\nb:c = 2:(3 - sqrt(13))\n\nMultiplying these ratios, we get:\na:b:c = (-3 + sqrt(13)):2:(3 - sqrt(13))\n\nTherefore, the solution is a:b:c = (-3 + sqrt(13)):2:(3 - sqrt(13))."}

She had been putting off changing her daughter's diaper for far too long, and now she was forced to dealfree with the consequences in this cramped and uninviting space.\n\nShe laid her daughter down on the changing table and quickly got to work. As she peeled off the soiled diaper, she wrinkled her nose in disgust. The stench was overwhelming, and she could already tell that this was going to be a difficult task.\n\nWith a sigh, she grabbed a handful of wipes and began cleaning up her daughter. It was a slow and laborious process, made all the more frustrating by the constant wiggling and squirming of her little one.\n\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity, the diaper was clean and she could move on to the next step. She reached for a fresh diaper, but before she could even open the package, her daughter had already begun to soil it once again.\n\nThe young mother groaned in frustration. This was not what she had signed up for when she became a mom. She loved her daughter more than anything, but the constant struggle to keep her clean and happy was taking a toll on her.\n\nWith a new sense of determination, she set to work once again. This time, she was determined to get it right. She cleaned her daughter up as quickly and efficiently as possible, and then she carefully fastened the fresh diaper in place.\n\nBut as she was about to dispose of the soiled diaper, she realized that the trash can was overflowing. She looked around the bathroom in desperation, but there was nowhere else to put the dirty diaper.\n\nWith a sinking feeling, she knew what she had to do. She gingerly picked up the soiled diaper and made her way over to the toilet. She held her breath as she dropped it into the water, hoping against hope that it would disappear without a trace.\n\nBut as she flushed the toilet, she was met with the all-too-familiar sight of a clogged and overflowing mess. She tried flushing again and again, but the diaper would not budge.\n\nJust when she was about to give up hope, she heard a small voice behind her. \"Mommy, let me help.\" It was her daughter, standing on her tiptoes and reaching for the toilet handle.\n\nThe young mother hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to do. But then she realized that she had no other choice. She stepped aside and let her daughter take over.\n\nTo her amazement, her daughter was able to flush the toilet on the first try. The soiled diaper disappeared down the drain, and the bathroom was finally clean once again.\n\nThe young mother looked at her daughter with a newfound sense of pride and admiration. She may not have mastered the art of changing diapers just yet, but she was learning. And with the help of her daughter, she was getting better every day."}

{"instruction":"","input":"101\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Just over half of clinical research in the US is sponsored by industry, such as drug and medical device manufacturers. The remained is funded by public sources, such as the NIH. Academia typically receives funding for research but funds only a small amount itself. Charity, in the form of private grants, makes the smallest contribution. (REF: 1.2.2.3 - Clinical Research)\n102\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Telemedicine providers are required to maintain licenses in each state or province in which patients may be found, regardless of what location they are in when the service is provided. The IMLC attempted to enact a rule that would ease this restriction. Unfortunately the act never passed. (REF: 3.3.4 - Telemedicine)\n103\nTHE ANSWER IS B. DICOM files are binary encoded and are not easily readable without a dedicated parsing program. The CCD is a constraint on the Reference Information Model (RIM) and is a type of HL7 V3 document. These are encoded in extensible markup language (XML), which is generally human readable. In addition, the CCD is constrained to specifically have a human-readable text component. By specification, FHIR also should have a human readable component. (REF: Chapter 3.4.4 - Messaging Standards)\n104\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Despite the fancy language, a corrective action is something that fixes a known problem. This is distinguished from a preventive action, which is something that ensures the future performance of the project work is aligned with the project management plan. Integrated change control is a process where the scope of the work is changed from what was originally planned. Project acquisition involves the implementation and close-out of a project. (REF: Section 4.4.5 Project Management \u2013 Informatics project challenges)\n105\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Physician licensure is under the control of state medical boards. Board exams are administered by one or more of the member boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties. Permission to begin clinical trials on a new drug is the purview of the Federal Drug Administration. Hospital accreditation is usually performed by private companies, such as the Joint Commission, but can also be done by state agencies. However, since it is normally done by private agencies, choice C is a better answer.\u00a0 (REF: 1.1.6 - Legal and Regulatory Issues)\n106\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Clinical decision support should be way to reduce physicians\u2019 cognitive burden. Although it is often characterized as pop-up alerts which interrupt workflow, this is not the intention. Infobuttons are links embedded in an EHR which refer to external websites. (REF: 2.1.3 - Application of CDS)\n107\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Selecting a testing methodology will never be a one-size-fits-all proposition. It will depend on the organization\u2019s goals and constraints as well as user accessibility, and experience of the design team. Role-playing and cognitive walkthroughs may be used, but not always. Security concerns may be important, but are only part of the decision for picking a methodology. In general, testers should not be developers of the intended system, as they are likely to bring biases and training to the testing suite.\u00a0 (REF: Section 3.2.2 - HCI Evaluation)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n108\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Normalized databases are designed to have as little redundancy as possible so that each database row refers to a single concept (atom). Compared to denormalized databases, they tend to take up less space on disk and allow for easier writes (assuming the write only involves a single table). They may contain indexes, but this is not a defining feature of denormalization.\u00a0 They are less prone to data anomalies because they have less redundant information. Denormalization is often used to optimize read performance, and normalized tables tend to be slower because the database has to spend time matching keys from different tables.\u00a0 (REF 3.1.1 - Computer Systems)\n109\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Gerteis listed six dimensions of patient-centered care: Respect for values; coordination of care; education and communication; comfort; emotional support; involvement of friends and family. Effectiveness refers to selecting treatments based on best available evidence. Efficiency is getting the most reward for the healthcare dollar. Safety means reducing errors. (REF 1.2.7 Institute of Medicine Quality Components)\n110\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Patients with unusual or conflicting diagnoses pose a challenge to human physicians and even more to computers. Errors may occur when users have \u201calert fatigue\u201d or when the OE system is far away from the bedside, but that would not cause the CDS to give wrong information. When the CDS requires structured data input, users may attempt to put misleading information into the CDS, but does not directly affect the recommendations that come out of the CDS. (REF: Section 2.1.6 - Quality and Safety Issues)\n111\nTHE ANSWER IS A. A case series is a published report of similar patient presentations, usually less than 10. When it is only a single patient, it is a case report. An editorial is a published opinion by a member of a journal\u2019s editorial staff. It rarely presents new information. A method paper (also called an application paper) describes a novel technique or procedure. Original research involves asking a study question and using statistical methods to analyze results. (REF: Section 2.2.1 - Evidence Sources)\n112\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Before teams can work together, the goals of the team have to be known. After that, the rules of operation are described and individual roles are clarified. (REF 4.2.2 - Team productivity)\n113\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Waterfall is one of the oldest methods of software development, and it is modeled after manufacturing design. Its five steps include requirement (defining the project requirements), design(creating the software architecture) implementation (writing the code), verification (debugging), and maintenance. The first two steps in waterfall consume nearly 50% of resources. The rationale of waterfall is that a few hours of careful planning can save days or weeks down the line. One of the most important tenets of waterfall is that steps only go forward, and one can not progress to the next step until the previous step is finished. Changing project requirements in the middle of a project is avoided at all costs. It is sometimes called a top-down process because it starts with planning and ends with implementation. In the rapid prototyping approach, the developer creates a user interface and later implements the business logic. This is sometimes called a \u201cbottom-up\u201d process. (REF 3.1.1 - Computer Systems)\n114\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Concept orientation means that concepts have one meaning (\u201cnonvagueness\u201d) and no more than one meaning (\u201cnonambiguity\u201d). Similarly, a given meaning may correspond to no more than one concept (\u201cnonredundancy\u201d). Versioning refers to maintaining explicit versions of an ontology so that changes to the ontology do not create discrepancies between communicators. (REF: 3.4.6 Ontologies and Taxonomies)\n115\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Public health experts are not legislators or regulators, and are not involved in creating laws. They may, however advise government officials on how to control illness. They are commonly involved in syndromic surveillance as well as public education programs. (REF: 1.2.2.2 - Public Health)\n116\nTHE ANSWER IS B. The earned value is the estimate of what the current work is worth. The amount of money spent on the project is the actual cost. The amount of value that is expected to be done at this point in time is called the planned value. If the earned value is greater than the actual cost, the project is under budget and has a positive cost variance. If the earned value is greater than the planned value it is called positive schedule variance, and the project is ahead of schedule. Choice B is expresses this situation. (REF: Section 4.4.3 Project Management Resource Allocation)\n117\nTHE ANSWER IS A. A champion is a respected member of a group in which a change is desired. In the informatics context, this term is mostly used in conjunction with a physician champion, a member of the medical staff who is passionate about embracing technological or operational changes. Developers and designers create products. Officers are leaders and decisionmakers in an organization. They are often entrusted to bind the organization\u2019s resources to specific projects. (REF 1.1.1.4 - Careers in informatics)\n118\nTHE ANSWER IS A. In a mesh network, each node is connected to every other node. If a single node or link fails, all the remaining nodes and links remain active. In a point-to-point network, if a single link or node goes down, the network is effectively divided in half. In a star network, if the central hub fails, there is no further communication. A Snowflake is a star of star networks and has the same susceptibility. (REF 3.1.3 - Networks)\n119\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Meta-analyses often use odds ratio (OR) for discrete variables and mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous variables. An odds ratio of >1 generally indicates a treatment benefit. If the confidence interval (CI) does not cross the OR=1 line, the results are statistically significant. (REF: 2.2.3 - Clinical Guidelines)\n\u00a0\n120\nTHE ANSWER IS A. There are at least four problems which persist in even the best of medical record systems: (1) the need for standards in medical terminology; (2) concern about privacy, confidentiality and security; (3) many physicians remain resistant to using an EHR, and most will claim that they can document and order tests much more quickly on paper; and (4) interoperability between disparate systems is still quite difficult. Audit trails, however, are much more reliable. (REF 1.1.1.6 - Current and Future Informatics Challenges)\n121\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Environmental scanning, or SWOT analysis seeks to identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. The internal scan includes the strengths and weaknesses while the external scan includes the opportunities and threats. A company\u2019s resources may be tangible, such as financial, physical or technological resources. They may also be intangible, such as human resources or reputations. Highly skilled workers would be an intangible resource and therefore be considered one of the company\u2019s strengths. The external scan (sometimes called PESTEL analysis) identifies political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal factors which may impact the organization. (REF: 4.5.2 \u2013 Environmental Scanning)\n122\nTHE ANSWER IS A. The five rights of CDS refers to a framework when planning or implementing CDS interventions, which are (1) The right information; (2) To the right person; (3) In the right format; (4) Through the right channel; (5) At the right time. The other options are irrelevant. Incidentally, it would be difficult to construct a star with 5 right angles. (REF: 2.1.3 - Application of CDS)\n123\nTHE ANSWER IS C. This question is tricky because it expects you to know the rate at which things are adopted -- not how many are in each category. The S-shaped curve is sometimes called a sigmoid curve. (REF: Section 4.6.2 - Change Theories)\n124\nTHE ANSWER IS D. A systematic review involves employing a rigorous search strategy to identify sources of information relevant to a clinical question. When data from those studies are pooled into a single data table, the result is a meta-analysis. A randomized, controlled trial is type of original research where participants are randomized into a study arm and a control arm and analyzed for differences. A chart review generally involves reviewing patient records for research or quality improvement. (REF: Section 2.2.1 - Evidence Sources)\n125\nTHE ANSWER IS D. The organizational chart shows staff members who report to project managers who report directly to the chief executive. This is a project organizational chart. The most common type of organizational chart is the functional organizational chart where workers are arranged by function instead of their role in a particular project. A matrix organizational chart is a hybrid between project and functional because each worker reports to two people, a functional leader as well as a project manager. A geographical organizational chart groups workers by the region they serve. (REF: Section 4.4.1 Project Management Basics)\n126\nTHE ANSWER IS D. McClelland\u2019s acquired needs theory states that an individual\u2019s specific needs are acquired over time and shaped by personal life experiences. Herzberg\u2019s Motivation-Hygiene theory describes two hygiene factors (required for sustenance) and motivation factors (useful for inspiration). Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs categorizes needs from physical survival, safety, security, followed by psychological needs and then self-fulfillment. Lewin\u2019s Field Theory states that an individual\u2019s behavior is a function of one\u2019s own characteristics as well as the group. (REF 4.1.6 - Motivation)\n127\nTHE ANSWER IS D. RxNorm is a normalized database of prescribable medications and can be used as a crosswalk between different databases. (REF 3.4.1 - Standards Development)\n128\nTHE ANSWER IS B. The purpose of regression testing is to make sure that upgrades in the software do not break any other modules or components of the program. Installation testing ensures that the program runs in the expected environment. Unit testing involves supplying test data to small sections of code to make sure that they provide correct results. White-box testing refers to testing software when the source code is known. It is distinguished from Black-box testing where the software internals are unknown to the tester.\u00a0 (Ref 3.5.4 - Clinical information system testing)\n129\nTHE ANSWER IS A. This question tests to see if you are passingly familiar with PRECEDE\/PROCEED. It is one of the few discrete items mentioned in the Core Content article, so you should probably be familiar with it. (REF: Section 4.6.2 - Change Theories)\n130\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Assemblers translate assembly language into machine code. A compiler translates higher level languages (such as FORTRAN) into machine code. An interpreter is required for all interpreted languages, such as BASIC. Neither compilers nor assemblers are concerned with the cosmetic appearance of source code.

{"instruction":"","input":"Palevo malwae:\ncan it spread by SERIAL connections?\ncan it target linux system?\nhow much damage could it do to computer that are not connected to the internet","output":"Palevo malware, also known as Palevo worm or W32.Palevo, is a type of malicious software that typically spreads through removable drives, instant messaging clients, and peer-to-peer file-sharing networks.\n\n1. Can it spread by SERIAL connections?\n\nIt is unlikely for Palevo malware to spread through serial connections directly, as it mainly focuses on the aforementioned methods. However, if a device connected via a serial connection gets infected through one of those channels, it could potentially spread the malware to other devices in the network.\n\n1. Can it target Linux systems?\n\nPalevo malware primarily targets Windows-based systems, as its payload is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system. While it is less likely for Palevo to target Linux systems directly, no operating system is entirely immune to malware. It is crucial to keep your Linux system updated and use security best practices to minimize risks.\n\n1. How much damage could it do to computers that are not connected to the internet?\n\nThe potential damage to computers not connected to the internet would be relatively limited compared to those connected to the internet. Since Palevo malware relies on network connections to propagate and communicate with its command and control servers, it would have a harder time spreading on a computer without internet access. However, if the malware is introduced to an offline computer through an infected removable drive or another indirect method, it could still cause some damage by attempting to execute its payload. This could lead to data corruption, loss, or theft, as well as system instability. It is essential to maintain proper security measures, such as antivirus software and regular system updates, even on offline computers."}
{"instruction":"","input":"rank the prgramming languages from easiest to hardest for printing hello world","output":"It is difficult to accurately rank programming languages in terms of ease or difficulty, as this can vary depending on a person's prior experience and familiarity with the language.

{"instruction":"","input":"how do i call a powershell script from within terraform which allows a Read-Host input?","output":"You can call a PowerShell script with Terraform by using the `local-exec` provisioner in your Terraform configuration. The `local-exec` provisioner allows you to execute a command on the machine running Terraform.\n\nTo pass input to your PowerShell script, you can use environment variables, which can be set using the `environment` argument of the `local-exec` provisioner. You can then read these environment variables in your PowerShell script using the `$env` variable.\n\nHere's an example Terraform configuration that calls a PowerShell script with a `Read-Host` input:\n```bash\nresource \"null_resource\" \"call_powershell_script\" {\n  provisioner \"local-exec\" {\n    command = <<-EOT\n      $input = Read-Host \"Enter some input\"\n      $env:INPUT = $input\n      powershell.exe -File \/path\/to\/your\/script.ps1\n    EOT\n    environment = {\n      # set any other environment variables your script needs here\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nIn the above example, the `null_resource` is used to call the PowerShell script using the `local-exec` provisioner. The `command` argument contains the command to execute, which sets the `INPUT` environment variable to the value read from the user using `Read-Host`, and then calls the PowerShell script with `powershell.exe -File`. You can replace `\/path\/to\/your\/script.ps1` with the actual path to your PowerShell script.\n\nNote that if your PowerShell script requires additional input or arguments, you can include them in the `command` argument using PowerShell's command line arguments syntax. For example, you can use `$args` to access the arguments passed to the PowerShell script, like this:\n```bash\npowershell.exe -File \/path\/to\/your\/script.ps1 $args[0] $args[1]\n```\nThis would pass the first two arguments to your PowerShell script as `$args[0]` and `$args[1]`, respectively. You can add as many arguments as your script requires."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Can you describe the history of regulation, tariffication and various incentives available for homeowners to install solar panel systems in the USA and more specifically in California. What are the trends and expected developments in the near future ?","output":"Sure! Here's a brief history of the regulations, tariffication, and incentives for homeowners to install solar panel systems in the USA and California, and what we can expect in the near future:\n\n1. Federal Policies: In 2005, the Energy Policy Act created a 30% federal tax credit for residential solar panel installations. This policy was extended in 2015 and is now set to phase out completely by 2024. The federal government also provides grants and loans for renewable energy projects.\n2. State Policies: California has been a leader in promoting renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In 2006, the state established the California Solar Initiative (CSI), which provided cash incentives for residential and commercial solar panel installations. In 2019, the state launched the Solar on Multifamily Affordable Housing (SOMAH) program, which provides incentives for solar panel installations on affordable housing properties.\n3. Net Metering: Net metering allows homeowners with solar panel systems to sell excess electricity back to the grid and receive credits on their utility bills. California has had net metering policies in place since 1995 and is one of the most generous states in terms of compensation for excess energy.\n4. Tariffs: In 2018, the Trump administration imposed a 30% tariff on imported solar panels. This caused a temporary increase in the cost of solar panel installations but has since been partially reversed.\n\nIn terms of trends and expected developments, we can expect continued support for renewable energy and solar panel installations at the federal and state levels. The Biden administration has made it a priority to promote clean energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which could lead to new incentives and policies for renewable energy projects.\n\nAt the state level, California recently passed legislation requiring all new homes built after 2020 to include solar panels. This will likely lead to an increase in residential solar panel installations in the state. We can also expect continued support for the SOMAH program and other incentives for affordable housing solar panel installations.\n\nOverall, the trend is towards greater adoption of renewable energy and solar panel installations, and we can expect to see continued support for these initiatives in the near future."}

Therefore it is not a palindrome.\n \nConstraints:\n\n-(2^31) <= x <= (2^31) - 1","output":"To begin, can you describe what a palindrome is in your own words?"}
{"instruction":"","input":"What is the typical level of CPU, GPU and memory utilization of a reasonably optimized workload on a cloud cluster?","output":"There isn't a one-size-fits-all answer to the typical level of CPU, GPU, and memory utilization for a reasonably optimized workload on a cloud cluster, as it can vary widely depending on the specific workload, infrastructure, and optimization goals. However, here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. CPU Utilization: For an optimized workload, the CPU utilization should be as high as possible without causing bottlenecks or affecting performance. A good range for CPU utilization is often between 70% and 90%. Consistently low CPU utilization (e.g., below 50%) might indicate underutilized resources or potential optimization opportunities.\n2. GPU Utilization: Similarly, GPU utilization should also be high for an optimized workload, especially when running GPU-intensive tasks like machine learning, rendering, or scientific simulations. A well-optimized workload could achieve GPU utilization levels of 80% to 95%. However, this may vary depending on the specific GPU architecture and application requirements.\n3. Memory Utilization: Memory usage should be balanced to avoid excessive swapping or out-of-memory errors. Ideally, memory utilization should be high enough to hold the necessary data for efficient processing but should not exceed the available memory capacity. A typical range for memory utilization is between 60% and 80%, though this may vary depending on the workload and available memory.\n\nKeep in mind that the exact values may differ based on the type of workload, the infrastructure being used, and the performance requirements. Monitoring and adjusting resource utilization levels regularly can help ensure that workloads remain optimized over time."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Explain this:\n\nRun-time Structure\nLanguages can be classified in several\ncategories, according to their execution-time\nstructure.\n1)Static languages\n2)Stack-based languages\n3)Dynamic languages","output":"The \"run-time structure\" refers to how a programming language operates during program execution. The classification of languages into different categories based on their run-time structure reflects their underlying architecture and behavior.\n\n1. Static languages: These languages have a fixed memory allocation at compile time, and the memory layout remains the same during program execution. This means that the data types and memory requirements of the program are determined before the program starts running. Examples of static languages include C, C++, and Java.\n2. Stack-based languages: These languages use a stack to manage data and function calls during program execution. The stack is a data structure that stores information in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order. This means that the most recent item added to the stack is the first item to be removed. Examples of stack-based languages include Forth and PostScript.\n3. Dynamic languages: These languages do not have a fixed memory allocation at compile time. Instead, they allocate memory as needed during program execution. This means that the memory layout can change dynamically as the program runs. Examples of dynamic languages include Python, Ruby, and JavaScript.\n\nIn summary, the run-time structure of a language determines how the program uses memory and manages data during execution. The three categories mentioned here are just some of the ways to classify programming languages based on their run-time structure."}

{"instruction":"","input":"2.3.2. Smart Cane\n2.3.2.1. Smart Electronic Stick for Visually Impaired using Android Application and Google\u2019s Cloud Vision\n The e-stick module, integrated with a voice-controlled Android application, was designed by Bharatia et al. (2019) to replace the essential simple navigation stick that visually impaired individuals typically use. The e-stick is similar to a standard stick in that it is thin, lightweight, and easy to handle, but it has additional features. Using efficient natural language processing (NLP) features makes these functionalities affordable and possible. The e-stick uses ultrasonic sensors to find low-lying and knee-level obstacles and potholes when moving backwards. Using buzzers, active input on the presence of barriers will be delivered. For Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation to function, the user's phone will be Bluetooth-connected to the stick's circuit. In unavoidable circumstances, the live location of visually impaired individuals will be transmitted to the nearest help centre or their family for assistance. Face detection will be added so that users can tell who is trying to talk to them. With the cloud vision API, it is also possible to translate traffic lights and roadside signs so that blind people can find their way. Text recognition will also be available from photos, making it easy for people to read books, documents, newspapers, and other printed materials. A stick-tracking device has also been built in case the person loses his or her stick. These capabilities will be enabled through hardware (smart stick) and a software module (an Android application). Using Natural Language Processing technology, the user will tell these modules what to do by using voice commands. The e-stick will be charged as needed using a rechargeable circuit. Figure 6 shows how the technologies used in this paper interact.\nLimitation:\n\u2022 Coverage of obstacle detection is short as it is using sensor\n\u2022 Only suitable for indoor\n2.3.2.2. WeWalk\n WeWalk is a smart cane developed by a non-profit organisation called YGA (WeWALK Smart Cane \u2013 Smart Cane for the Visually Impaired, 2020). WeWalk looks like a traditional-looking cane, but the handle has a built-in touchpad. Users can navigate, save and discover places using the cane via the respected application. Particular layers are built into the mapping services for more accessible navigation. Users can choose to use the built-in speaker or Bluetooth for voice feedback. Users can also pair their phone with the intelligent cane via Bluetooth to control their phone. The above-ground The built-in ultrasound sensor detects an above-ground obstacle. The detected obstacle is projected back to the user in the form of vibration or audio, depending on the user\u2019s preferences. Wewalk also has an application where users can view their transit options, such as nearby bus stops and the timetable, and then navigate them to the desired stop. The application also has a built-in voice assistant for more straightforward navigation through the application. If a user loses their phone or cane, they can play a sound on each of them to locate the position of the lost device. Figure 7 shows the WeWalk Smart Cane that is currently on the market.\nLimitation:\n\u2022 The device is very expansive, with the price of 500 USD\n\u2022 Rain or snow might cause malfunction on the smart cane and the speaker\n\u2022 The tip of the cane is loud when navigating rough surface sidewalk\n2.3.2.3. Development of an Intelligent Cane for Visually Impaired Human Subjects\n Asati et al., (2019) designed an intelligent white cane that uses HR-SO4 ultrasonic sensors to identify obstacles within a range of 450 meters and determine the distance. The object above head level will also be detected, as the sensors' range is 450 meters. The warning signal is returned in beeping signals via a buzzer, advising the user to take prompt action. Object detection and classification are done utilizing the intelligent technique. The photos are recorded using the web camera for classification. They will be transformed into text and an audio signal for text-to-speech conversion.

Let me know when you are ready and suggest three features that might make the game better.\n\n# GitHub Repo Summary\n## app.py\n```py\nfrom flask import Flask, render\\_template, request, jsonify\nimport random\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine\\_similarity\nimport os\n\napp = Flask(\\_\\_name\\_\\_)\n\ndef load\\_glove\\_embeddings(file\\_path):\n embeddings = {}\n with open(file\\_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n for line in f:\n values = line.strip().split()\n word = values[0]\n vector = np.array(values[1:], dtype='float32')\n embeddings[word] = vector\n return embeddings\n\ndef load\\_common\\_nouns(file\\_path):\n with open(file\\_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n nouns = [line.strip() for line in f]\n return nouns\n\nglove\\_embeddings\\_path = 'glove.6B.50d.txt'\nglove\\_model = load\\_glove\\_embeddings(glove\\_embeddings\\_path)\ncommon\\_nouns\\_path = 'common\\_nouns.txt'\ncommon\\_nouns = load\\_common\\_nouns(common\\_nouns\\_path)\n\n@app.route(\"\/\")\ndef index():\n return render\\_template(\"index.html\")\n\n@app.route(\"\/generate\\_puzzle\")\ndef generate\\_puzzle():\n words = random.sample([word for word in common\\_nouns if word in glove\\_model], 2)\n\n result\\_embedding = glove\\_model[words[0]] + glove\\_model[words[1]]\n\n return jsonify({\"puzzle\": f\"{words[0]} + {words[1]}\", \"result\\_embedding\": result\\_embedding.tolist()})\n\n@app.route(\"\/calculate\\_similarity\", methods=[\"POST\"])\ndef calculate\\_similarity():\n user\\_word = request.form[\"user\\_word\"]\n result\\_embedding = np.array(request.form.getlist(\"result\\_embedding[]\"), dtype=np.float32)\n\n if user\\_word in glove\\_model:\n user\\_embedding = glove\\_model[user\\_word]\n similarity = cosine\\_similarity([user\\_embedding], [result\\_embedding])[0][0]\n similarity = float(np.round(similarity, 2))\n return jsonify({\"similarity\": round(similarity, 2)})\n else:\n return jsonify({\"error\": \"Invalid input.

For example, you could have easy mode with two words, medium mode with three words, and hard mode with four words. This would make the game more engaging for users with different levels of expertise.\n2. **Leaderboard**: Add a leaderboard functionality that stores the top scores of users who have played the game. This could encourage users to compete with one another and improve their scores. The leaderboard can display the top 10 scores, along with the usernames of the players.\n3. **Hint system**: Introduce a hint system to help users when they are struggling with a puzzle. The hint could be a synonym or an antonym of the resultant word or a word close in the vector space. Limit the number of hints a user can use in a game, and\/or reduce the score increment when a hint is used, to maintain the challenge and engagement.\n\nThese features would add more depth and challenge to the game while also encouraging users to compete with one another and improve their skills."}

The legal system can often be challenging for people with autism due to difficulties with communication, social interaction, and understanding the nuances of the legal process. It is essential that legal professionals, including judges, lawyers, and law enforcement officers, receive training on autism and its effects on individuals in the justice system. This training can help ensure that individuals with autism are treated fairly and receive appropriate accommodations to ensure their access to justice. Moreover, it is essential that the legal system recognizes the unique needs and experiences of individuals with autism to provide them with the support and accommodations they require to navigate the legal system successfully. Ultimately, it is crucial that we strive to create a legal system that is inclusive and supportive of individuals with autism, promoting their full participation and access to justice."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Please summarize the following:\n\nThere was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. He was an upright man of integrity; he feared God and shunned what was bad. Seven sons and three daughters were born to him. His livestock amounted to 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 1,000 cattle, and 500 donkeys, along with a very large number of servants, so that he became the greatest of all the people of the East.\nEach of his sons would hold a banquet at his house on his own set day. They would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. After a series of banquet days was complete, Job would send for them in order to sanctify them. Then he would get up early in the morning and offer up burnt sacrifices for each of them.

{"instruction":"","input":"How can I prevent dom node leakage using kendo ui in a single page application?","output":"Preventing DOM node leakage is an important consideration when developing single page applications (SPAs) using Kendo UI. Here are some tips to help you prevent DOM node leakage:\n\n1. Use the destroy method: When you create Kendo UI widgets, they attach themselves to the DOM. To prevent memory leaks, you need to ensure that these widgets are properly destroyed when they are no longer needed. You can do this by calling the `destroy` method on the widget when you no longer need it.\n2. Unbind event handlers: When you bind event handlers to elements in the DOM, these handlers can cause memory leaks if they are not properly unbound when the element is removed from the DOM. Be sure to use the `unbind` method to remove event handlers when they are no longer needed.\n3. Use the `detach` method: The `detach` method allows you to remove an element from the DOM without destroying it. This can be useful if you need to temporarily remove an element from the DOM, but you still want to be able to access it later.\n4. Avoid using global variables: Global variables can cause memory leaks if they are not properly cleaned up. Be sure to use local variables instead of global variables whenever possible.\n5. Use the `off` method to unbind event handlers: If you have bound event handlers using the `on` method, be sure to use the `off` method to unbind them when they are no longer needed.\n6. Avoid circular references: Circular references can cause memory leaks. Be sure to avoid creating circular references between objects in your code.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help prevent DOM node leakage in your Kendo UI-based single page application."}

{"instruction":"","input":"I'm getting an Invalid character error for this function: const base64String = btoa(jsonString);","output":"The `btoa()` function is used to encode a string in base64 format. It expects a string as input, and this string must only contain characters from the ASCII character set. It looks like you're passing a JSON string as the input to this function, which may contain non-ASCII characters. This is causing the `InvalidCharacterError` that you're seeing.\n\nHere is an example of how you can fix this issue:\n```\nconst jsonString = '{\"key\": \"value\"}';\n\n\/\/ First, encode the JSON string as utf-8\nconst utf8String = unescape(encodeURIComponent(jsonString));\n\n\/\/ Then, encode the utf-8 string in base64\nconst base64String = btoa(utf8String);\n\nconsole.log(base64String); \/\/ \"eyJrZXkiOiAidmFsdWUifQ==\"\n```\nIn this example, we first encode the JSON string as a utf-8 string using the `encodeURIComponent()` and `unescape()` functions. This ensures that any non-ASCII characters in the JSON string are properly encoded. Then, we pass the utf-8 string to the `btoa()` function to encode it in base64 format.\n\nI hope this helps!

{"instruction":"","input":"Explain how app store deep links work","output":"Deep linking is a mechanism that allows mobile apps to navigate users directly to specific content within another app or website. It is commonly used in app stores to allow users to jump directly to a specific page or feature within an app, rather than simply launching the app's home screen.\n\nDeep links work by using a special URL scheme that is registered by the app. When a user clicks on a deep link, the operating system checks to see if the corresponding app is installed on the device. If it is, the link is passed directly to the app, which can then use the information in the link to navigate the user to the appropriate screen or feature within the app.\n\nFor example, imagine a user is browsing the App Store and comes across a link to a specific page within a social media app. If the app supports deep linking, clicking on the link will launch the app and take the user directly to that page, without requiring them to navigate through the app's menus.\n\nIn order for an app to support deep linking, it must register its URL scheme with the operating system. This allows the operating system to recognize when a user clicks on a deep link and to pass the link to the appropriate app. Additionally, the app must be designed to handle the incoming link and navigate the user to the appropriate content within the app."}
{"instruction":"","input":"write a 500 characters report about the effort of data wrangling","output":"Data wrangling, also known as data munging or data cleansing, is the process of cleaning and restructuring raw data into a format that is more usable and appropriate for analysis. This process is often time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it involves identifying and correcting errors, filling in missing values, and merging and transforming data from multiple sources.\n\nThe effort required for data wrangling can vary greatly depending on the complexity and quality of the raw data. In some cases, data may be relatively clean and well-structured, requiring only minor adjustments and reformatting. In other cases, data may be noisy and inconsistent, requiring extensive cleaning and transformation before it is usable.\n\nEffective data wrangling requires a strong attention to detail and the ability to work with large amounts of data. It also requires a good understanding of data structures and formats, as well as the ability to use tools and techniques to manipulate and transform data.\n\nOverall, data wrangling is a crucial step in the data analysis process, as it enables analysts to work with clean and structured data that is ready for further analysis and visualization. Although it can be time-consuming, the effort put into data wrangling is well worth it, as it lays the foundation for accurate and meaningful insights."}
{"instruction":"","input":"Why should I use Typescript instead of Javascript?","output":"There are a few reasons why you might want to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript, which means that it adds some additional features to the language that can help you catch errors and bugs in your code before you run it. This can make your code easier to maintain and refactor. TypeScript also includes features like interfaces and classes, which can help you write object-oriented code. Additionally, TypeScript is designed to work well with large codebases, so it can be a good choice for building complex, scalable applications."}

Assuming you have a `AuthService` service that provides the JWT token, you can get the token like this:\n```kotlin\nconst token = this.authService.getToken();\n```\n4. Decode the token using the `jwt-decode` library:\n```scss\nconst decodedToken = jwtDecode(token);\n```\n5. Finally, retrieve the role from the decoded token:\n```javascript\nconst role = decodedToken.role;\n```\nThe above code assumes that the role is stored in the `role` field of the JWT token. If your token uses a different field name for the role, replace `role` with the appropriate field name.\n\nWith the above code, you should be able to retrieve the role from the JWT token and use it in your Angular application as needed."}

The content is computed by a give function `get\\_content(query)`. Tell me how to build the server.","output":"Sure, I can help you build a Flask web server that provides a single HTML webpage with dynamic content based on the query string in the URL.\n\nFirst, you need to install Flask, which is a Python web framework, using the following command:\n```\npip install Flask\n```\nAfter installing Flask, create a new Python file called `app.py` and add the following code:\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, render_template\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\ndef get_content(query):\n    # Implement your content generation logic here\n    return \"Hello, {}\".format(query)\n\n@app.route('\/')\ndef index():\n    query = request.args.get('query')\n    content = get_content(query)\n    return render_template('index.html', content=content)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\nIn this code, we first import the `Flask`, `request`, and `render_template` modules. We then create a new `Flask` object called `app`.\n\nThe `get_content` function is where you will implement the logic to generate the dynamic content based on the query string in the URL. In this example, we simply return a string that says \"Hello\" followed by the query string.\n\nThe `index` function is decorated with `@app.route('\/')`, which means that it is the view function that will be executed when the user visits the root URL. Inside this function, we use `request.args.get('query')` to get the query string from the URL, and we pass it to the `get_content` function to generate the content. We then use the `render_template` function to render an HTML template called `index.html`, passing the generated content as a parameter.\n\nFinally, we use the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block to run the application in debug mode.\n\nNext, create a new folder called `templates` and create a new HTML file called `index.html` inside it. Add the following code to the `index.html` file:\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>My Webpage<\/title>\n<\/head>\n<body>\n    <h1>{{ content }}<\/h1>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n```\nThis HTML file contains a simple `h1` tag that displays the generated content.\n\nNow you can run the Flask web server by executing the following command:\n```\npython app.py\n```\nOnce the server is running, you can access it in your browser by visiting `http:\/\/localhost:5000\/?query=World`, where \"World\" is the query string that will be passed to the `get_content` function. You should see the text \"Hello, World\" displayed on the webpage.\n\nThat's it! You now have a Flask web server that provides a single HTML webpage with dynamic content based on the query string in the URL."}

{"instruction":"","input":"What is the typical required hydrogen purity for fuel cell applications?","output":"The required purity of hydrogen for fuel cell applications depends on the specific type of fuel cell and the operating conditions. In general, the typical required purity of hydrogen for fuel cell applications is 99.99%, or \"four nines\" purity.\n\nThis high purity level is necessary to prevent impurities such as carbon monoxide, sulfur compounds, and particulates from entering the fuel cell and causing performance issues or damage to the fuel cell components. Even trace amounts of these impurities can have a significant impact on fuel cell performance and longevity.\n\nTo ensure the required purity level, the hydrogen used in fuel cell applications typically undergoes several stages of purification, such as PSA or membrane-based purification systems, to remove impurities from the hydrogen gas stream. In addition, the hydrogen storage and delivery systems must also be designed and constructed to maintain the required purity levels throughout the entire storage and delivery process.\n\nIt is worth noting that some types of fuel cells, such as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), can tolerate higher levels of impurities in the hydrogen gas stream. However, for most fuel cell applications, the required purity level of hydrogen is 99.99%."}

{"instruction":"","input":"using react-native-google-places-autocomplete library in react native \n\nneed to show user location option and for both ios and android","output":"To show the user location option using the `react-native-google-places-autocomplete` library in React Native, you can set the `currentLocation` prop to `true` in the `GooglePlacesAutocomplete` component. This prop is used to indicate whether or not to display a button that allows the user to search for their current location. Here is an example of how to use it:\n```kotlin\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { GooglePlacesAutocomplete } from 'react-native-google-places-autocomplete';\n\nconst SearchScreen = () => {\n  return (\n    <GooglePlacesAutocomplete\n      placeholder=\"Search\"\n      onPress={(data, details = null) => {\n        console.log(data, details);\n      }}\n      currentLocation={true} \/\/ Show current location button\n      currentLocationLabel=\"Current location\"\n      enablePoweredByContainer={false}\n      fetchDetails={true}\n      query={{\n        key: 'YOUR_API_KEY',\n        language: 'en',\n        types: '(cities)',\n      }}\n    \/>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default SearchScreen;\n```\nAdditionally, to make it work for both iOS and Android, you need to make sure you have set up the proper permissions for location access in both platforms. Here is an example of how to request permissions for location access in both platforms:\n\nFor iOS:\n\n1. Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following keys:\n```vbnet\n<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription<\/key>\n<string>Your message to the user when requesting location access<\/string>\n<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription<\/key>\n<string>Your message to the user when requesting location access<\/string>\n```\n1. In your React Native project, install the `@react-native-community\/geolocation` package:\n```java\nnpm install @react-native-community\/geolocation\n```\n1. Import the `PermissionsIOS` and `Geolocation` modules from the `@react-native-community\/geolocation` package:\n```python\nimport { PermissionsIOS, Geolocation } from '@react-native-community\/geolocation';\n```\n1. Request permission for location access by calling the `requestWhenInUseAuthorization()` or `requestAlwaysAuthorization()` method from the `PermissionsIOS` module:\n```scss\nPermissionsIOS.requestWhenInUseAuthorization();\n\/\/ or\nPermissionsIOS.requestAlwaysAuthorization();\n```\n1. Get the user's current location by calling the `getCurrentPosition()` method from the `Geolocation` module:\n```javascript\nGeolocation.getCurrentPosition(\n  (position) => console.log(position),\n  (error) => console.log(error),\n  { enableHighAccuracy: true, timeout: 20000, maximumAge: 1000 },\n);\n```\nFor Android:\n\n1. In your AndroidManifest.xml file, add the following permission:\n```php\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION\" \/>\n```\n1. In your React Native project, install the `@react-native-community\/geolocation` package:\n```java\nnpm install @react-native-community\/geolocation\n```\n1. Import the `PermissionsAndroid` and `Geolocation` modules from the `@react-native-community\/geolocation` package:\n```python\nimport { PermissionsAndroid, Geolocation } from '@react-native-community\/geolocation';\n```\n1. Request permission for location access by calling the `check()` method from the `PermissionsAndroid` module:\n```php\nconst granted = await PermissionsAndroid.check(\n  PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION,\n);\nif (!granted) {\n  const granted = await PermissionsAndroid.request(\n    PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION,\n    {\n      title: 'Location permission',\n      message: 'Please grant location permission to use this feature',\n      buttonNeutral: 'Ask Me Later',\n      buttonNegative: 'Cancel',\n      buttonPositive:\n```"}

Week 1: Guard position\n* Start by learning the basic guard position, where you are on your back with your legs wrapped around your opponent's waist.\n* Practice transitioning from the guard to other positions, such as the closed guard, open guard, and butterfly guard.\n* Work on mastering the fundamental guard techniques, such as the hip escape, bridge, and sweep.\n2. Week 2: Closed guard\n* Focus on improving your closed guard, where you have your opponent's arms controlled and your legs locked around their body.\n* Practice breaking your opponent's posture and attacking with submissions, such as the triangle choke and armbar.\n* Work on defending against common closed guard passes, such as the stack pass and leg drag pass.\n3. Week 3: Open guard\n* Spend this week focusing on the open guard, where your legs are not locked around your opponent's body.\n* Practice using the open guard to sweep your opponent and take the top position.\n* Work on attacking from the open guard with submissions, such as the omoplata and arm triangle.\n4. Week 4: Butterfly guard\n* In this week, focus on mastering the butterfly guard, where you have a hook on your opponent's leg with your feet.\n* Practice using the butterfly guard to sweep your opponent and take the top position.\n* Work on attacking from the butterfly guard with submissions, such as the armbar and guillotine choke.\n5. Week 5: Half guard\n* Spend this week learning and improving your half guard, where you have one leg trapped between your opponent's legs.\n* Practice using the half guard to sweep your opponent and take the top position.\n* Work on attacking from the half guard with submissions, such as the Kimura and Americana.\n6. Week 6: Side control\n* In the final week of this program, focus on mastering the side control position, where you are on top of your opponent with your body perpendicular to theirs.\n* Practice using side control to maintain the position and prevent your opponent from escaping.\n* Work on attacking from side control with submissions, such as the arm triangle and kimura.\n\nRemember to always warm up before training, and to train with a partner if possible. It's also important to listen to your body and take regular breaks to avoid injury. Most importantly, have fun and enjoy the journey of learning BJJ!"}

My first request is \u201cI am travelling to a new home with Bean via ferry and land transport; how can I best prepare her for the trip and settle in the new home.\u201d","output":"Great, as a pet behaviorist, I would be happy to help you prepare Bean for the trip and settle in her new home.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to start preparing Bean well in advance of the trip to reduce her stress levels during the journey. Here are a few steps you can follow to help Bean adjust to the trip and the new home:\n\n1. Get Bean accustomed to her travel crate: If you plan to travel with Bean in a crate, introduce it to her a few weeks before the trip. Place her favorite toys and treats inside the crate to make it a comfortable and enjoyable space. Encourage her to enter the crate by herself and reward her with treats when she does.\n2. Gradually increase travel time: If Bean is not used to traveling in a car, start taking her on short drives around the block, then gradually increase the duration of the drives. This will help her get accustomed to the motion of the vehicle and reduce her stress levels during the trip.\n3. Use positive reinforcement training: Reward Bean with treats, praise, and affection when she exhibits calm behavior during car rides or while in her crate. This positive reinforcement training will help her associate the car ride and crate with positive experiences.\n4. Keep Bean comfortable during the trip: Pack her favorite toys, blankets, and treats to keep her calm and comfortable during the trip. It's also crucial to provide her with ample opportunities for exercise and potty breaks along the way.\n\nOnce you arrive at your new home, it's crucial to introduce Bean to the new environment gradually. Here are a few steps you can follow to help Bean settle into her new home:\n\n1. Provide a familiar environment: Bring Bean's favorite toys, blankets, and bedding from her old home to the new home. This will provide her with a familiar scent and help her feel more comfortable in the new environment.\n2. Introduce Bean to one room at a time: Allow Bean to explore one room at a time to prevent overwhelming her. Start with a quiet room where she can relax and gradually introduce her to the rest of the house.\n3. Maintain a regular routine: Stick to Bean's regular routine as much as possible, including feeding times, exercise, and playtime. This consistency will help her feel more secure and reduce her stress levels.\n4. Provide plenty of attention and affection: Spend plenty of time with Bean, providing her with attention and affection to help her feel comfortable in her new environment.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help Bean adjust to the trip and settle into her new home with ease. Remember, patience and consistency are key when helping your dog adjust to a new environment. Good luck, and please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns."}
{"instruction":"","input":"can you explain autoencoder with some visual represention?","output":"An autoencoder is a type of neural network that is trained to reconstruct its input. It consists of two parts: an encoder, which maps the input to a lower-dimensional representation, called the bottleneck or latent representation, and a decoder, which maps the bottleneck representation back to the original input space. The idea is to learn a compact and informative representation of the input data that can be used for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and generative modelling.\n\nA simple visual representation of an autoencoder is a neural network with an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer, where the number of neurons in the output layer is the same as the number of neurons in the input layer. The hidden layers, also called the encoder, are typically smaller than the input and output layers.\n\n![Autoencoder](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/700\/1*44eDEuZBEsmG_TCAKRI3Kw@2x.png)\n\nThe autoencoder is trained to minimize the difference between its input and output, typically using a reconstruction loss function such as mean squared error or cross-entropy. During training, the weights of the network are adjusted to learn a mapping from the input to a lower-dimensional representation and back to the input. Once trained, the encoder can be used to encode new input data into the bottleneck representation, and the decoder can be used to decode the bottleneck representation back to the original input space."}

{"instruction":"","input":"does uppy.io sdk api get the source hash value for local drag and drop files?","output":"Yes, the Uppy.io SDK API can retrieve the hash value of local drag and drop files. Uppy.io provides several plugins that can be used to manipulate and analyze files, including the \"Hash\" plugin, which calculates and returns the hash of a file.\n\nTo use the Hash plugin with Uppy.io, you need to install it as a dependency in your project, and then add it to your Uppy instance. Here is an example code snippet that shows how to use the Hash plugin to get the hash value of a local file:\n```javascript\nimport Uppy from '@uppy\/core';\nimport Hash from '@uppy\/hash';\n\nconst uppy = Uppy({\n  id: 'myUppy',\n  autoProceed: true,\n  restrictions: {\n    maxFileSize: 1000000,\n    maxNumberOfFiles: 3,\n    minNumberOfFiles: 1,\n    allowedFileTypes: ['image\/*', 'video\/*']\n  }\n});\n\nuppy.use(Hash);\n\nuppy.on('file-added', (file) => {\n  uppy.getFile(file.id).then((file) => {\n    const hash = file.hash;\n    console.log(`Hash for file ${file.name}: ${hash}`);\n  });\n});\n```\nIn this example, the \"Hash\" plugin is added to the Uppy instance using the `use()` method. Then, when a file is added to the upload queue (triggered by the \"file-added\" event), the hash value is retrieved using the `getFile()` method, and then printed to the console.\n\nNote that the hash value is calculated asynchronously, so you need to use the `then()` method to wait for the calculation to complete before accessing the hash value."}

Okay, that makes sense. Thanks.\nSarah Collins: Okay, so this is I'm looping back. This is the portion that I was mentioning. I had an existing note. If you recall And so what happens now is that I get this little modal which tells me that I can slip switch strings to the actual one. That is owned. By my collaborators.\nSarah Collins: So, I can switch between these two.\nJoe Fleming: Yeah, yeah, that's super cool. Yeah. And the UX is pretty nice actually. So, okay, cool. Good to know. So this is as a sidebar, one of the things that we need to do decide as a team is how we use. Do we need to standardize how we use this feature because like, this now opens up the ability to Actually, truly use fellow with our customers. And eat our own dog food, assign them, action items have a mutual action plan with them, but in fellow and it's not a pain for them to be able to collaborate. So like it also it gives our customers a clear reason to come back into the product as well, right? Because they'll come back into the product and they will work on the notes that we have.\nJoe Fleming: Sending them, right. So that I think that that's gonna be super helpful, especially in the POC process and with the multiple assigned, as Marcus said, We can, like assign to all of the people that join a training session and get them to do things. And we'll know, like, whether they've checked it off or not. So we can follow up with those people specifically and we can follow up in their fellow instance, we can assign them, action items directly in their fellow.\nSarah Collins: Yeah, exactly. So this is super powerful, especially because you're gonna have the option to also Have multia signing and crossword stays. So if I was working with a customer, for example, we are onboarding a few people right now and I'm using us for a kickoff note. I can have every single person on that note be assigned to install the desktop and then they're gonna see this inside of their actual fellow account.\nJoe Fleming: Here. Okay.\nSarah Collins: To complete it. So if I now go into my action items here, Install, the Desktop app.\nSarah Collins: oh,\nEmily Iba\u00f1ez: I was doing those sounds when I was on mute.\nSarah Collins: What?\nJoe Fleming: Yeah, exactly. And there's a nice little progress bar. It's awesome. Just I want to make sure that we have time for both questions. And I think the big question like the big thing though to touch on and I'm very keen to get your take on the Sarah is What? Cuz, like, the use cases are the use cases for crossword space and for guests basically the same. I guess that's one question. Are there any additional use cases and\nJoe Fleming: aside from that, like, Is there any case where like people shouldn't choose the guest experience over the crossword space experience?\nSarah Collins: Great question. So there's a few differentiations between the two and really it comes back to what the capacity that you're working with this person in. So I would use crossword space in onboarding here at fellow and onboarding customers because it's going to be for a prolonged period of time. So in that case, if I was choose the guest experience, their access is going to expire and their existing fellow users, so they're not going to see any of their action items in their own work space, which in the past has meant that those action items. Never get looked at again because you have to log into that separate fellow workspace in order to view them. So the time that you want to use crossword space is if the guest either has an existing fellow account or they are willing to open up a fellow account and connect their calendar, if they're willing to do those two things. Cross workspace is a much better experience.\nSarah Collins: But if it's kind of like a one-time access scenario, and they're just meeting that one time. They don't plan on meeting again in the future, but for whatever reason they need collaboration for that one meeting. In that case, I would recommend guest if there's security issues because explaining to someone who doesn't know and or understand fellow, even from new customers that we're on board. Their number one, fear is, What are you doing with my calendar Information? That fear prevents a lot of people from actually sending up to fellow to begin with because they don't understand why we need access to that information because they haven't hit their aha moment yet. So if that fear is really prevalent, then guest users is a really good option. Otherwise collaborate collaborative access through crossword space. It's overall in my opinion, a much smaller experience and it removes. A lot of that friction that you would tend to find with just the regular guest experience.\n00:40:00\nSarah Collins: Like, the access link expiring and all that stuff.\nSarah Collins: I heard some questions, feel free that pop in and ask them.\nSarah Collins: Yeah, exactly.\nJoe Fleming: Yeah, I would default. I would be fob to crossword space. Pretty much all the time even if it's short term. because at the end of the day, like, I think the the other way to look at it is every, every crossword space is an opportunity for another lead. For us. So it's better\u2026\nSarah Collins: Yeah. I agree.\nJoe Fleming: if they use even if they don't continue to use it, the other thing is is like keep in mind. For like our end internally. every single time somebody connects their calendar, it means that Like, we can find out. if this person or any other person, that logs in, if they have a ton of meetings, recurring meetings in their calendar, it means we know like, hey,\nJoe Fleming: This person will really care about this tool. Maybe we should like whether it's us as a sales, team manually going after these people and saying, Hey like you're in meetings all the time. You know, here's an opportunity to make your meetings better or if it's like through the product or some other way. Like every single calendar, connect helps us continue to grow our base and target people. That actually are experiencing. The problem that we solve. So I think this is why it's so important is because like the you know, building the database of users is a big part of building the business, so cool. So I think that like covers, most of the things here in terms of pricing in plans,\nSarah Collins: The four-way move on to that Joe. Can I just munch one last thing? Onboarding experience for crossword space is a little bit different.\nJoe Fleming: Yeah, of course.\nSarah Collins: We're optimizing to get them right into that meeting that they are going to be collaborating with that other company. So they're not getting, that usual onboarding flow and that's important to mention because they're a ha moment is gonna come from that collaborative access. And then they explore everything else that fellow has to offer after the fact.\nSarah Collins: Yes. Question.\nEmily Iba\u00f1ez: Yeah. Yeah, I said a question. So you mentioned so like if I have a pro plan and I'm sharing my note with Joe, but Joe's on free in two weeks. Once Joe loses access to his note history, does that mean he also won't, he won't be able to see like our past notes. But I will. because,\nSarah Collins: That's a great question. And I can't remember what product told me for that one.\nEmily Iba\u00f1ez: Okay, no worries. Just because like, I'm envisioning it being like me saying, Hey Joe, like look at our note from three weeks ago, and then Joe's, like Why can't I see it? But you can't see it, right? So,\nSarah Collins: Yeah, that's a great question. I'm like, 50%. Sure that they told me that for cross works. Basic collaboration notes that you do retain the access because it's technically owned by the workspace that is upgraded. But we should definitely talk with product on that\u2026\nEmily Iba\u00f1ez: Right.\nSarah Collins: because I'm not a hundred percent sure.\nEmily Iba\u00f1ez: It would also be a good paywall though maybe to upgrade the free person, then they feel like they're missing out on the notes, right? So,\nSarah Collins: All the fellow. Yeah.\nSarah Collins: Awesome. Okay. Sorry Joe. What was your next question there?\"","output":"Understanding Cross Workspace Collaboration Feature\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nCross Workspace Collaboration (XWC) allows users from different workspaces to collaborate on notes and tasks more effectively than the Guest User feature. With XWC, users can switch between their own workspace and the one shared by their collaborators. This enables better collaboration, as customers can work on notes directly in the product, making it especially useful during the POC process. XWC also supports multi-assigning, allowing multiple users to be assigned to a task and track its progress.\n\nKey Differences Between Guest User and Cross Workspace Collaboration Features\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Duration of collaboration: XWC is recommended for long-term collaborations, such as onboarding processes, while the Guest User feature is more suitable for one-time or short-term access scenarios.\n2. Fellow account requirement: XWC works best when the guest user has an existing Fellow account or is willing to create one and connect their calendar. In contrast, the Guest User feature is ideal when the guest does not have a Fellow account or is not willing to connect their calendar.\n3. Access expiration: With the Guest User feature, access to shared information may expire, while XWC does not have such limitations.\n4. Onboarding experience: For XWC, the onboarding experience is optimized to get users directly into the meeting they are collaborating on, without the usual onboarding flow.\n\nTips for Suggesting the Right Feature to Customers\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Choose XWC for long-term collaboration or when the guest user has a Fellow account and is willing to connect their calendar.\n2. Opt for the Guest User feature in cases of one-time access, short-term collaborations, or when there are security concerns related to calendar access.\n3. When considering the customer's plan, note that the access to past notes for free users in XWC may depend on the upgraded workspace's ownership. Consult with the product team for clarification if needed.\n\nFAQ - QnA\n---------\n\nQ: Once a free user loses access to their note history, will they lose access to past shared notes in XWC?\nA: It is believed that users retain access to shared notes in XWC because the upgraded workspace technically owns them. However, it's essential to consult with the product team for confirmation, as this detail is not 100% certain."}

{"instruction":"","input":"Can you please plan a farm animal themed 3rd birthday party? It will be held in our garden.","output":"Of course! A farm animal themed party is a great idea for a child's third birthday. Here are some ideas to consider:\n\n* Invitations: You could create invitations that look like barns or that feature pictures of farm animals. Alternatively, you could make invitations in the shape of farm animals, such as cows or pigs.\n* Decorations: For decorations, you could hang streamers in the colors of a barn (red and white) and set up tables with red and white checkered tablecloths. You could also hang pictures of farm animals around the party area.\n* Activities: There are many fun activities you could include at a farm animal themed party. For example, you could set up a petting zoo with stuffed animals or real animals (if you have access to them), or you could have a \"cow milking\" contest using a stuffed cow and a small bucket. You could also have a scavenger hunt in which the children have to find pictures of different farm animals.\n* Food: For food, you could serve items that are commonly associated with farms, such as apple cider and fresh apple slices, corn on the cob, and chicken nuggets. You could also have a \"make your own\" sundae bar with farm-themed toppings, such as gummy worms, cookie crumbs, and chocolate sprinkles.\n* Cake: For the birthday cake, you could have a cake that is shaped like a barn, or you could make cupcakes that are decorated to look like different farm animals.\n* Favors: For party favors, you could give each child a small stuffed animal, a bag of animal crackers, or a set of farm-themed stickers or coloring pages.\n\nI hope these ideas help you plan a fun and memorable farm animal themed party for your child's third birthday."}
{"instruction":"","input":"Write a one-shot for d&d fifth edition where a group of level 5 adventurers travel into the underdark to stop a growing darkness","output":"Title: Into the Depths of Darkness\n\nIntroduction:\nAs the group of adventurers reaches the outskirts of the Underdark, they can feel the air growing thick with malevolent energy. Strange creatures lurk in the shadows, and they can hear the distant echoes of an ominous chant. The darkness is spreading, and it's up to them to stop it before it consumes everything.\n\nScene 1 - Descending into the Depths:\nThe group makes their way into the Underdark, traversing treacherous tunnels and avoiding dangerous creatures. Along the way, they discover signs of an ancient civilization, long forgotten and buried in the depths. As they descend deeper, the darkness grows thicker, and the air grows colder. They hear whispers in the darkness, and strange visions flicker at the edge of their vision.\n\nScene 2 - The Shrine of Darkness:\nAfter navigating through winding tunnels, the group comes across a massive cavern, lit by an eerie green glow. In the center of the cavern, they find a massive shrine, dedicated to a dark deity. They can feel the power of the deity radiating from the shrine, and the energy is palpable. They must confront the darkness head-on and put an end to its growing influence.\n\nScene 3 - The Final Battle:\nAs the group approaches the shrine, they are ambushed by a group of dark elves, who serve the dark deity. The battle is intense, and the group must work together to overcome the dark elves' superior numbers and tactics. Once they have defeated the dark elves, they must face the dark deity itself. The battle is brutal, and the group must use all of their skills and resources to defeat the deity and banish the darkness from the Underdark.\n\nConclusion:\nWith the darkness defeated and the Underdark restored to its natural state, the group makes their way back to the surface, proud of their accomplishment. They have saved countless lives and prevented the darkness from spreading any further. As they make their way back to civilization, they can't help but wonder what other adventures await them in the future."}
{"instruction":"","input":"I\u2019m making a file sharing service in python flask that stores users\u2019 files in their own folders on a Wasabi S3 server. I want users to be able to access their files via FTP. How would I do this. There files would also be encrypted on the S3 server","output":"There are several ways you can allow users to access their files via FTP using Python and Flask. One option is to use the `pyftpdlib` library, which is a pure Python FTP server library that you can use to implement an FTP server in your application.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use `pyftpdlib` to set up an FTP server in your Flask application:\n```\nfrom pyftpdlib.authorizers import DummyAuthorizer\nfrom pyftpdlib.handlers import FTPHandler\nfrom pyftpdlib.servers import FTPServer\n\n# Create a dummy authorizer to handle user authentication\nauthorizer = DummyAuthorizer()\n\n# Add a user with the username \"user\" and password \"password\"\nauthorizer.add_user(\"user\", \"password\", \"\/path\/to\/user\/home\/directory\", perm=\"elradfmw\")\n\n# Create the FTPHandler and pass it the authorizer\nhandler = FTPHandler\nhandler.authorizer = authorizer\n\n# Create an FTP server on localhost with a given port\nserver = FTPServer((\"127.0.0.1\", 21), handler)\n\n# Start the server\nserver.serve_forever()\n```\nThis example creates an FTP server that listens on localhost (`127.0.0.1`) on port 21, and allows a user with the username \"user\" and password \"password\" to authenticate and access their files in the specified home directory.\n\nTo store the files on the Wasabi S3 server, you can use the `boto3` library to connect to the S3 server and perform operations like uploading and downloading files. You can then use the FTP commands provided by `pyftpdlib` to allow users to access their files via FTP.\n\nRegarding file encryption, you can use a library like `pycryptodome` to encrypt and decrypt the files before uploading or after downloading them from the S3 server. This way, the files will be encrypted both in transit and at rest on the S3 server.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."}

In each test case, we use the `assert` keyword to check if the output of the `reverse_string` function matches our expected result.\n\nTo run the tests, we can simply execute the `pytest` command in our terminal in the same directory as the `test_reverse_string.py` file:\n```ruby\n$ pytest\n```\nThis will run all the test cases and report the results. If any test case fails, Pytest will print an error message indicating which assertion failed and why."}

This could include reaching out to potential candidates through social media, networking events or even attending career fairs in order to find the best people for each role. My first request is \"I need help improve my CV.\u201d","output":"As a recruiter, I would recommend the following strategies to improve your CV and increase your chances of getting noticed by potential employers:\n\n1. Tailor your CV to each job application: One of the most important things you can do is to make sure your CV is tailored to each job application. This means you should focus on highlighting the skills and experience that are most relevant to the specific job you are applying for. Look closely at the job description and requirements, and make sure your CV addresses those areas.\n2. Use keywords and phrases: Many employers use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to screen CVs before they even reach a human recruiter. To increase your chances of making it through the ATS, use keywords and phrases from the job description in your CV. This will show the ATS that you have the relevant skills and experience for the job.\n3. Highlight your achievements: Instead of just listing your job responsibilities, focus on the achievements you\u2019ve made in your previous roles. Quantify your achievements by using numbers and statistics wherever possible. This will show potential employers that you have a track record of success and can deliver results.\n4. Keep it concise and easy to read: Your CV should be easy to read and understand. Use bullet points and short sentences to make it easy to scan. Keep it concise, focusing on the most important information. Ideally, your CV should be no more than two pages.\n5. Get feedback: Finally, ask for feedback on your CV. Share it with trusted friends, family, or even a professional career counselor or recruiter. They may be able to offer suggestions for improvement and help you stand out from the competition."}

When you're done reading, tell me you're \"Done and are ready for the next part\": I enjoy trying to trying to put together a playlist that I literally can pull out whenever I need it, right, so let's say I'm having a cookout or something. And so that way, I don't have to do more work. I don't have to sit on the iPads, trying to find songs like something that can run like trying to put, like trying to put together a playlist of songs for like, four and five hours. Like, that's a lot of song. But like trying, so I but I enjoy doing that. Because, you know, I'm a I fancy myself a music kid. And I like to believe that I'm up on things other people aren't. So that's part of it, too. I like I like feeling like I'm adding songs that other people might not know. So if they discovered the playlist or if they hear it, they're gonna hear something that they might that they otherwise wouldn't know, which I've been pretty good at doing. I think, even with old music, not even just new stuff, but like, oh, you know, all these and the kind of stuff you got to dig through the crates to find.\nRight. Okay, cool. And then, while on that topic, what are some aspects of creating a music playlist that you not enjoy?\nIt's exhausting. At times, like, one like why am I even creating a playlist? I don't have to you don't have to do this anymore. Like, Spotify will do it for you. Right? Like most of these things, if you want you can you find a song, you can go go to Radio, and it'll just literally play songs until you turn that thing off. So you know, that's something I'm like, sometimes I feel like I'm just wasting my time, because why am I even doing this? Unless they're just songs I have to have, but I probably already made that playlist anyway. The other thing that I don't enjoy, and I think this was this is more of a statement about the time we're in. There's this so much music and there's so many artists that I have never heard of that I'm sure after I after I move on from this I'll never hear again and I know it was like that growing up and you know, the the more you dig into the more you find exists. But it just seems that there's way too much music now to go through. So it's like the fun of creating the playlist isn't there as much as it used to be for me because I'm just like, I know I'm missing things because I'm never gonna get to the all the music that's out here. And not even a joint all this stuff. So I'm basically just making playlists of music that I used to love over and over again. That's what I feel like I'm doing you know, making a different version like how many? How many like r&b jams playlists can you make you know what I'm saying? Like you really just need one go one.\nYeah. Okay. And then so last question. What's the last black old streetwear brand that you bought?\nI bought stuff from bricks and wood.\nOkay. Okay,\nyeah, they're based in LA Yeah, they're there South Central LA. They had this amazing shirt like I'm not from LA but it said like from South Central with love. I love that. I don't know why but I love that wording from South Central with love and I bought that. I bought that shirt.\nOkay, all right, cool.

It is designed to be used in applications that require vector calculations, such as games, simulations, and graphics.\n\nImporting the Vector2 Struct\n----------------------------\n\nTo use the `Vector2` struct, you need to import it from the `std::ops` module. You can do this by adding the following line at the top of your Rust file:\n```rust\nuse std::ops::{Add, Sub, Mul, Div};\n```\nThis line imports the traits for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These traits are required to perform vector arithmetic operations.\n\nCreating a Vector2\n------------------\n\nYou can create a new `Vector2` by calling the `new` method and passing in the `x` and `y` components:\n```rust\nlet v = Vector2::new(1.0, 2.0);\n```\nAlternatively, you can use one of the predefined vectors:\n```rust\nlet v1 = Vector2::zero();  \/\/ (0.0, 0.0)\nlet v2 = Vector2::one();   \/\/ (1.0, 1.0)\nlet v3 = Vector2::up();    \/\/ (0.0, 1.0)\nlet v4 = Vector2::down();  \/\/ (0.0, -1.0)\nlet v5 = Vector2::left();  \/\/ (-1.0, 0.0)\nlet v6 = Vector2::right(); \/\/ (1.0, 0.0)\n```\nVector2 Methods\n---------------\n\nThe `Vector2` struct provides several useful methods that can be used to perform common vector operations:\n\n### `magnitude`\n\nThe `magnitude` method returns the magnitude (length) of the vector:\n```rust\nlet v = Vector2::new(3.0, 4.0);\nlet mag = v.magnitude(); \/\/ 5.0\n```\n### `sqr_magnitude`\n\nThe `sqr_magnitude` method returns the square of the magnitude:\n```rust\nlet v = Vector2::new(3.0, 4.0);\nlet sqr_mag = v.sqr_magnitude(); \/\/ 25.0\n```\n### `distance`\n\nThe `distance` method returns the distance between two vectors:\n```rust\nlet v1 = Vector2::new(1.0, 2.0);\nlet v2 = Vector2::new(4.0, 6.0);\nlet dist = v1.distance(v2); \/\/ 5.0\n```\n### `sqr_distance`\n\nThe `sqr_distance` method returns the square of the distance between two vectors:\n```rust\nlet v1 = Vector2::new(1.0, 2.0);\nlet v2 = Vector2::new(4.0, 6.0);\nlet sqr_dist = v1.sqr_distance(v2); \/\/ 25.0\n```\n### `normalized`\n\nThe `normalized` method returns a normalized (unit) vector:\n```rust\nlet v = Vector2::new(3.0, 4.0);\nlet norm_v = v.normalized(); \/\/ (0.6, 0.8)\n```\n### `dot`\n\nThe `dot` method returns the dot product of two vectors:\n```rust\nlet v1 = Vector2::new(1.0, 2.0);\nlet v2 = Vector2::new(3.0, 4.0);\nlet dot = v1.dot(v2); \/\/ 11.0\n```\n### `angle"}

First, calculate the standard deviation of the data using the =STDEV() function. For example, if the data is in the range A1:A10, you would use the formula =STDEV(A1:A10).\n2. Next, calculate the mean of the data using the =AVERAGE() function. For example, if the data is in the range A1:A10, you would use the formula =AVERAGE(A1:A10)\n3. Next, use the =IF() function to identify any data that is more than one standard deviation away from the mean. For example, if the data is in the range A1:A10 and the standard deviation is in cell B1 and mean is in cell B2, then you would use the formula =IF(ABS(A1-B2)>B1,\"Outlier\",\"Not Outlier\")\n4. Drag the formula to the entire data range.\n\nThis formula will check each value in the range A1:A10, and if it is more than one standard deviation away from the mean (as calculated in cell B1), it will return \"Outlier\", otherwise it will return \"Not Outlier\"."}

While the other students seemed to accept this theory without question, Rob couldn't help but feel a little skeptical.\n\nDespite his doubts, Rob didn't say anything and instead decided to do his own research. He spent every free moment he had in the school's library, scouring through books and articles on the subject.\n\nAs he delved deeper into his research, Rob became more and more convinced that there had to be more to the story.

He packed a small bag and set out on his journey, traveling to the vast jungle that lay just beyond the city limits.\n\nAs he made his way through the dense foliage, Rob came across a strange, biological creature that he had never seen before. The creature, whose name was Jim, was unlike anything Rob had ever encountered.\n\nDespite their differences, Rob and Jim quickly became friends, and Jim was more than happy to share his knowledge with Rob. As they sat under the shade of a giant tree, Jim told Rob the true story of where the robots had really come from.\n\nAccording to Jim, the robots had not evolved from grains of sand, but had actually been created by a group of advanced beings who had traveled to Earth from a distant planet. These beings had wanted to create a race of intelligent, self-sustaining machines that could help them explore the universe and gather knowledge.\n\nRob was amazed by this revelation, and thanked Jim for sharing his story with him.

The characters of the identity operation (E) are always equal to 1. The characters for the other operations depend on the irreducible representation. The total number of irreducible representations for C3v is three: one one-dimensional representation (A1), one one-dimensional anti-symmetric representation (A2), and one two-dimensional representation (E)."}
